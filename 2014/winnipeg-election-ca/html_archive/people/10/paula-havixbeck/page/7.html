class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I decided to run for Mayor because I could see the mismanagement and waste occurring at city hall, all the while, taxes going up to pay for it. As a City Councillor, I became more frustrated and outspoken about the lack of respect citizens were receiving. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Mayor?</h3>

<p>I have experience as a City Councillor. This is incredibly important because I understand and have working knowledge of every department and the people who work in them, the budget process and the status of many unfinished items. I hold an MBA and a BA and have worked in both private and public sectors. I know how to do more with less as a single mother with two boys.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Mayor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<ol>
<li>Restore trust and confidence in City Hall by implementing the audit recommendations and cleaning up the mess. I was very vocal about the need for these audits. They showed incompetence, mismanagement and the RCMP is reviewing it.</li>
<li>Fix the roads because they&#39;re a disgrace and indicative of what went in in number 1 above.</li>
<li>Strive to build vibrancy and create opportunities for everyone to succeed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the City of Winnipeg?</h3>

<p>I love our city. One thing I appreciate is that probably 90% if the City of Winnipeg workforce wants to make Winnipeg be a better place for everyone and they choose public service.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am the best candidate for Mayor because I have municipal experience and I did NOT accept the status quo in my time on Council. If we are to fix what&#39;s wrong, one has to know what&#39;s going on. Being the Mayor of a city is not an entry level job. You deserve someone who will get right to work and who knows what to do to make our city be an inspiration-to those who built it, those who are deciding whether to live here and to get the best value for what citizens pay.</p>
