candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve been happy and proud to serve as a school trustee here for the last four years and am running for re-election. Four years ago I decided to run because my children were entering the school system and wanted to make a positive difference. I was active with our parents group and daycare board before becoming a trustee. I am a lawyer, but my parents were both teachers and I grew up with a solid knowledge of educational issues.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I have gained a lot of experience during my time on the board. I have chaired the Education and Policy committees and am currently the Finance Chair. In that role, I guided and shaped our division&#39;s budget and learned a great deal about how our finances operate. As a practicing criminal lawyer, I have a great deal of experience dealing with people and complex issues which is very valuable to the board. My parents were both teachers and I grew up with a solid knowledge of educational issues.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I will prioritize responsible budgeting. We have kept taxes low in tough times by shifting spending from administration to the class room. School safety is also important. We have introduced anti-bullying and human diversity policies. I would also stress equal access to education. I believe everyone deserves the best chance to succeed. Finally, I would stress ensuring that all our students have strong literacy and numeracy skills. We have put in place standards to ensure that our goals in these areas are being met.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I very much appreciate the strong sense of community that I have found in our ward and our division. People are very passionate about and involved in our schools. I want to do everything I can to make sure that citizens continue to be engaged with our schools.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I have lived in this ward all of my life. I went to the schools here. When the time came to raise a family, my wife and I choose a house that is two blocks from the house that i grew up in because I knew the strong school system and strong sense of community that we have here. I want to do my part to make sure our local schools not only stay strong but continue to improve.</p>
