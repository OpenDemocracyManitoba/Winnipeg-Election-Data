<p>The Louis Riel School Division is well governed and administered; but it took a lot of &quot;blood, sweat and tears&quot; to arrive at this point since the amalgamation in 2002. However, there is always room for improvement and new opportunities present new challenges for enhancing public education. When boards are, &quot;knowledgeable, informed, skillful and resourceful, interdependent and proactive, they use their collective wisdom to drive the school division toward excellence&quot;, (M. Rosenberger, MSBA. 2012.). The School Board must be cognizant that its collective wisdom is derived and developed from respective collaboration and cooperation of a group of individual trustees working in harmony with its community towards a defined goal.
I look forward to continued participation in ensuring stron governance in Louis Riel School Division for our greater community by developing further the four pillars of good governance: stewardship, leadership, responsibility and accountabilty.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>My career has been very diversified...just like our schools and students. I have been employed as a flight operations agent with Delta airlines, an entrepreneur in the retail grocery business, and finally as a teaching principal i the Sunrise School Division instructing students from grades 5 to 12 in a multi-age Englishj immersion educational setting. I have served on the Board at the Winnipeg Technical College and as Chair of the Technical Vocational Education Committee in the Louis Riel School Division In addition, I have also served on many committees in boththe former St.Vital School Division No.6 and currently in the Louis Riel School Division. I am an advocate for solid English Program and French Immersion Program education. In addition, I believe in technical vocational education and strongly feel that students must have access to technical vocational programs to engage in meaningful learning thereby maximizing their opportunities in the work world after their journey through our public schools.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I would like to ensure accountability in education to our community. Why? There has been a media focus on internatinal test results that indicate Manitoba&#39;s children are not as successful as those in other provinces. We need to ensure that our schools are preparing chidren for the future in all subject areas.
I would like to expand our English as an Additional Language to include support for newcomer parents in their struggle to enhance their language skills. Why? Stronger language skills leads to better job opportunities, independence and support of their children&#39;s language development.
Our increasing Aboriginal student enrolment in Louis Riel requires appropriate programming to connect Aboriginal students with school and permit them to harmonize their culture with public education. Why? Relevant and appropriate programming will lead to a higher graduation rate and independence.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>You can read the complete answers from Dave Richardson on Facebook</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Yes, a proposal.
I would like to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of our educational delivery by surveying secondary graduates 2 to 3 years after they have settled into post-secondary education, trade schools, apprenticeship programs, or jobs. We need to learn more from our former students. Did the Division prepare its graduates to be successful in their choices? Did the Division help students become engaged in their learning and model good citizenship skills?</p>
