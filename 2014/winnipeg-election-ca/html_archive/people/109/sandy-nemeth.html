class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>From a purely personal standpoint, the role has been so incredibly rewarding that I want very much to continue to serve the community as a school trustee.  I am also seeking re-election to ensure the divisional priorities for student learning in LRSD remain relevant and measurable.  I&#39;d like to see government mandated programs and initiatives funded at their real cost to school divisions.  No one would dispute the value of reducing class sizes from kindergarten to grade 3 to 20 students, but millions of dollars will be spent by LRSD alone to pay for the costs associated with this directive, which has impacted our budget and the taxes our community pays.  Finally, I am running to advocate for the important and necessary work of school boards and school trustees, and continued efforts to create the community partnerships that will not only strengthen public education, but broaden and enhance the programs, resources and supports we will continue to offer students and families. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>As a parent, I continue to offer a perspective that I felt was lacking on the board up until the 2010 election, but which has been significantly enhanced since that time with the election of 3 trustees with children in LRSD schools. I&#39;ve chaired all board standing committees and have a solid understanding of board policy and practice, as well as an appreciation of the role of trustees as governors of their school division. I have thoroughly enjoyed visiting all of our schools, which has allowed me to meet and get to know students, parents, staff and school administrators, as well as gain an appreciation of the unique culture, climate and needs of each school. The experience I bring is that of a current trustee fully immersed in, engaged in, and committed to, an elected position I understand, enjoy, and consider vitally important in the community. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>As a current trustee running for re-election I stand for (in no particular order): </p>

<p>• protecting visual and performing arts, band, choir, and music programs, and supporting opportunities for students to share and celebrate their talents in these areas;</p>

<p>•  policies, programs, and decisions that ensure LRSD schools and buildings remain safe, inviting, welcoming, non-judgmental, barrier, bias, and stereotype free learning and working environments;</p>

<p>•  supporting our students and families living in poverty, and those who are newcomers to Canada; </p>

<p>• broad and innovative uses of social media and technology in schools and classrooms to promote the acquisition of digital literacy skills, to support and enhance learning and teaching, and to provide opportunities for engagement with our parents and families both near and far; </p>

<p>• ongoing and relevant professional development for all LRSD staff; </p>

<p>• regular contact with all members of our community to share ideas, gather feedback, inform our decisions and to simply talk about public education, community values and the future of LRSD.</p>

<p>This is not a complete list by any means. Several of these particular issues regularly come up in conversation with the community I represent, making them important to me and important to mention. </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>This past year we had to solve the negative pressures that some serious overcrowding was putting on two of our french immersion program schools in ward 3. Every school based forum was extremely well attended by parents who were concerned how proposed changes might affect their family. It was an emotional time for many, and I remain appreciative of the participation of literally hundreds of parents, and their willingness, desire, and commitment to being part of the process from the very begining. This is what community looks like; people coming together to understand, talk, share, collaborate, and work together. As a result of this process, I see more of this advocacy around some new conversations in our schools, and, I see students starting to demand to be heard which is nothing short of terrific.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>My sincere thanks to all of the students, parents, teachers, staff, administrators, board office staff, trustee colleagues in LRSD, Manitoba, and Canada who I have met and spoken with over the last 4+ years.  Your willingness to engage in conversation and debate has allowed me to better understand the current and emerging issues and challenges facing public education from multiple important perspectives, which has made me a more effective, engaged, and enlightened trustee. </p>
