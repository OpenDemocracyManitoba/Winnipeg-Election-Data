Election?</h3>

<p>I am currently retired following a wonderful and satisfying career in the St. Boniface School Division.  My passion and desire to improve educational opportunities for our students
kept me interested in our education system and with the encouragement of members of the local community, I decided to enter the elections for school trustee.  I strongly believe that education is the building block for our future and the future of our youth.  Communities and countries that do not have a strong public education system do not succeed and struggle to reach their full potential.  Maintaining and continually looking to improve the Louis Riel School Division is the driving force that motivates me to work for our community and the students within our schools.  We (the teachers, principals, superintendent&#39;s team, parents, community members, and the Board) have accomplished much in the Louis Riel School Division since the amalgamation of Norwood, St. Boniface, and St. Vital.  Our division is respected throughout the province for the manner in which it deals with difficult decisions, and the positive way we involve the community in our plans for the future.  I would love to be part of that future.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I first became an elementary teacher at Beliveau School.  My career led me from my grade 6 classroom to the position of  Supervisor of Physical Education.  During that time, St. Boniface became the first division in Manitoba to have a daily physical education program.   I later became the principal of Beliveau Junior High School, Pierre Radisson Collegiate, and Windsor Park Collegiate.  As a community member I was a coach in the Winakwa soccer program, the University of Winnipeg soccer program, and the Legion Track and Field Camps throughout the province and at the International Peace Gardens.  I served on the Operations board of the Pan American Games and was President of the Manitoba Track and Field Association and later, the president of the Manitoba Lacrosse Association.  I was a Board member of the Manitoba School Boards Association  as the vice-president and as a Director of suburban boards. Other boards include: the St. Boniface School Board, the Canadian Lacrosse Association,, and MANTRA [the Manitoba Tobacco Reduction Association].  I currently am president of the Manitoba Lacrosse Hall of Fame as well as a member of the of the Community Connections committee and the Negotiations committee of the Louis Riel School Division.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Our world changes, and as it changes our division must be prepared to meet the needs of the children who live in our community. Example: We now have family centers to assist young mothers and fathers in preparing their children  for a successful entry into school life and we are also providing more vocational programs for high school students. I believe we have to put a strong emphasis on the teaching of literacy and numeracy.  That currently is one of our goals and everyone in the division, including parents, must work towards those goals and we need to follow up our actions with a reliable source of data that shows we have benefitted student learning.  I also strongly support creative arts programs, vocational programming, and school and community joint use programs.  Emphasis must also be given to programs and opportunities to prepare our youth to become contributing members of society.  We have to plan for the maximum development of each and every child. At this time we must also provide our students with the best technical resources possible.  We must ensure that we will provide a positive, and safe educational climate that allows for success in learning for all students.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>As a principal, I have witnessed the completion of Windsor Park and the beginnings of Southdale.  As a trustee I have seen the birth of Island Lakes, Royalwood, Southland, and now Sage Creek.  I have watched them grow and weave them selves into really positive communities.  As it is with your community, It is the same for Boards. We all come from different wards and from different parts of the division.  However, our goal is to take responsibility for the entire division and ensure that all students have the best possible opportunity to learn and be successful.  We have to learn how to weave our selves into a team that can govern and lead our division in a positive direction.  That is easier said than done.   What I appreciate about our division is the willingness of trustees to work together for a common cause which benefits the students and the larger community.  We have disagreements and different views of the world.  However, we have learned that if we can&#39;t work as a team, negative things happen.  I appreciate team work and  I know that there is always something extra you can do to improve your skills.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>If you talk to my colleagues, you will find out my passion for the importance of education in our society is still strongly motivating me to run again for the position of trustee in Louis Riel SD and I would like to represent you in Ward 4.  I am not running because I have one single cause I want to change.  I am not running because I have future dreams of being an MLA or MP.  I put my name forth because I am genuinely interested in the education of our youth.  I work part time at Red River College and so I have the time to visit schools and keep in touch with community groups and members.  My experiences are part of the skill set I bring to the position.
