we decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>School boards are comprised of citizens who invest significantly to ensure that the children in their communities are well-served with programs and supports that respect unique local needs. They develop partnerships with their community, while they honour the values of stewardship. They make &quot;tough&quot; decisions at the local level to serve all students&#39; best interests, even through some decisions will not receive universal support. I want to be part of that decision making process. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I have been a school trustee for 26 years. I&#39;ve chaired all education standing committee&#39;s. I&#39;m the present Chair of the Louis Riel School Board and a Past President of the Manitoba School Board Association</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>All issues are important when it effects children&#39;s education. They are the future of this country. Enhancing children&#39;s learning capacity should be at the top of everyone&#39;s list. Politics won&#39;t go away but we can try to minimize its impact on what is good for children. We must speak as a community with one voice on educational matters.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The Louis Riel School Division have been progressive thinkers, doing the right thing for what is required for all student&#39;s education. The school ward parent is well versed in what is needed for their children&#39;s education along with the combined effort of working together in a teamwork atmosphere from within the divisional community.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Serving the educational community as a school trustee for 26 yrs., dealing with a very large educational division budget. I feel that my experience is needed and very much required to ensure that all children get the best possible career opportunities and an education that will serve them well into the future. I believe in Servant Leadership to Build a Community.  </p>
