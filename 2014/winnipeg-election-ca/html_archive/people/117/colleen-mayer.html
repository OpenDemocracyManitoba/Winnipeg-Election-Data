class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>As a current School Trustee for the Louis Riel School Division, my decision to run for Re-election is based on my desire to continue working on behalf of the residents of St. Vital.  This is the community I call home.  My husband and I raise our children here and I choose to continue to work in Old St. Vital.  Being a School Trustee has allowed me the opportunity to make a real difference at a grassroots level and continue to connect with those in my community most affected by divisional issues.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>Working with the Louis Riel School Board for the past three years, I have chaired and worked on numerous committees where I have gained the knowledge and experience necessary to continue my contribution to the Division.  I believe this has strengthened my understanding of the work that takes place in the school division and the community as a whole.</p>

<p>I have also gained invaluable experience over the past 14 years working alongside and supporting many St. Vital organizations and businesses.   Some of these include: </p>

<p>• Executive Director of the Old St. Vital Business Improvement Zone - supporting local business through revitalization and beautification
• Committee Member for the City of Winnipeg’s Combined Sewer Overflow Master Plan
• Committee Member on the Manitoba School Board Association’s - Child Care Regulatory Review &amp; MUST Fund 
• Community partner with the Marlene Street Resource Centre
• Member of the St. Vital Community Action Network
• Former Administrative Coordinator for the St. Vital Parent Child Coalition
• Past Board Member of the  Windsor Community Centre and Windsor Cares for Kids Daycare</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I strongly believe in:</p>

<p>• Early Childhood Development for pre-school children
• Strong educational building blocks, such as literacy and numeracy skills
• Safe and inclusive schools for all students
• Citizenship and community involvement
• Fiscally responsible budgets that balance community needs and school requirements
• Continued professional development for all staff
• Offering space for more before and after school programs</p>

<p>In my experience these issues are fundamental to the continued growth and strength of our education system.  I believe these represent the foundation to which we continue to build our schools and communities on, and I am committed to continuing that success.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The strong sense of community.  As one of the current School Trustees for Ward 2, I am proud to be part of a community where residents are continually engaged in community issues and very supportive of each other.  I have a strong connection to Old St. Vital as it is where I have chosen to raise my children, work and call home.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I wish to thank everyone who has been supportive of me, as their current School Trustee, for the past three years.  It is an honour to represent families and community members at the local level and I look forward to again having that opportunity to continue working with staff, students, their families and the community at large over the next few years.  Together we are making a difference.</p>
