Election?</h3>

<p>Back in the 1980&#39;s while upgrading my education then studying to be an insurance broker, I met long time NDP City Councillor Magnus Eliason who became my friend and mentor and I have been involved in politics ever since. I have ran before and have also worked behind the scenes in the political process. I believe I can be a vibrant independent voice for the people of Daniel Mac. I have a strong social conscience combined with good business acumen that has served me well in the world.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I ran for city council in 1989. The wards were smaller back then. I ran in the Redboine Ward which also included the west end and had been represented by long time NDPer and CCFer Magnus Eliason. He fully supported me in my efforts. I ran for the NDP and was endorsed by the Winnipeg Labour Council. I lost by a heartbreaking 100 votes.  I ran for School Trustee in 1995 coming in 6th out of more than 20 other candidates. I have also worked behind the scenes. Throughout the 1990s I served as the Legislative Assistant for Dr. Conrad Santos, the long time NDP MLA who represented the Broadway then the Wellington Constituency. I have served on numerous Boards and Commissions in my life and continue to work as an interpreter with the Winnipeg Police Services, various branches of the legal system, the Workers Compensation Board, as well as the Immigration and Refugee Board. I&#39;ve also been successful building my own business so I have a good business mind combined with my compassionate spirit. I have political experience plus close ties to the ward both in terms of my professional and personal life.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<ol>
<li>Accountability and Transparency: We need an Oversight Committee so that we don&#39;t have the cost over-runs or shady business deals that we have had the last 10 years.</li>
<li>Infrastructure and Transportation: Starting in the Spring of 2015 we need pothole crews working 24/7 on our streets and back lanes and in the winter we need timely snow removal from our sidewalks and streets without blocking people&#39;s access to their properties.</li>
<li>Community Safety: Reduce or eliminate photo radar and put Cadets and Police Officers where they are most effective-in our Schools, Community Centres and on our streets. </li>
<li>Environment: Develop a recycling depot in the area that takes everything from bottles to batteries and compost.</li>
<li>Rejuvenation of Sargent and Ellice Avenues: I believe with the expansion of the University of Winnipeg and our designation as Centre Port this has become an even more pressing issue. Sargent and Ellice can rival both Osborne and Corydon and the dynamic communities they represent.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>From my professional, volunteer, political and personal experience with the ward I know it&#39;s an incredibly diverse, multicultural mosaic made up a of myriad of communities. In essence, it is a host of communities within the Daniel Mac community itself.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I want people to know that I&#39;m readily accessible. I can be reached at 204-228-9000, via e-mail: johncardosocampaign2014@gmail.com or visit my website at www.johncardoso.ca where you will find more information about my election platform, endorsements, community events and my life.</p>
