class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I ran in 2010 because I thought politics should be done differently at city hall and that I had the best combination of roots in the community, experience and ability to make that change. I still feel that way today. I came within 108 votes of being there to make change then and I am working even harder to be there this time.</p>

<p>Our community remains strong and vibrant but our roads and back lanes are terrible and the basic city services like snow clearing have suffered. </p>

<p>I grew up in Daniel McIntyre and I&#39;m raising my children here now. They use the same community facilities. I understand the issues.  I have seen the community develop over the years and have tried to be a positive part of that change.  With a new Mayor coming to council there will be change and I want to be part of that change. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I have a broad range of experience and abilities that I think are needed for a Councillor.</p>

<p>My early experience includes first hand knowledge of the community facilities I used growing up and attending Tec Voc where I graduated as the class valedictorian. As an adult I attended the University of Winnipeg studying Political Science. Working in our family insurance business Home Securities in Wolseley gave me an appreciation of the contribution that small businesses make to the community and serving as a School Trustee has helped me understand the tough decisions public officials have to make about services and budgets. My experience serving as a board member of the Social Planning Council of Winnipeg has improved my understanding how social issues like poverty and affordable housing addiction and mental health affect the quality of life in our community.  </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>The big issues on peoples&#39; minds are the state of our crumbling infrastructure, the quality of our basic city services and the way business is done at city hall. There is also concerns that we need affordable housing and a multi level government strategy to deal with the poverty and social issues.</p>

<p>To improve the infrastructure deficit we need a short term increase in funding for emergency repairs to potholes and back lanes and a long term commitment to keep maintenance levels adequate. Basic services like snow clearing could be better planned using tools like reserve accounts. On years when the snowfall is light we could set the savings aside in a reserve account and on years like last year with an extraordinary high snowfall funds would be available to clear the streets properly.</p>

<p>We need a housing strategy which adds 350 new affordable housing units and a moratorium on condo conversions until the apartment vacancy rate improves. The City of Winnipeg needs to work with social agencies and other governments to address the issues of poverty and safety. </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I appreciate the character and the diversity of Daniel McIntyre. I grew up here and I have seen the changes in the neighbourhood and I have tried to be a positive part of that change.  I want my children to grow up in the same strong and vibrant community that I did and I want Winnipeg to be a strong and vibrant city . </p>

<p>Daniel McIntyre has a mixture of people from different cultural and economic backgrounds and that makes it a great place to live and raise our children. I want to do my part to keep it moving forward.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>This election is important. We are going to have a new Mayor and we need to do things differently at city hall. I don&#39;t believe in party politics at city hall and I will work with the new Mayor and whoever is elected to council in an effort to keep Daniel McIntyre a strong and vibrant community in a strong and vibrant Winnipeg.</p>

<p>I have a good understanding of the community and the experience needed to make the tough choices.</p>

<p>My approach to problem solving is no nonsense but collaborative and cooperative. I will use my best judgement in what I believe is in the best interest of Daniel McIntyre and the city of Winnipeg and I will be transparent and accountable. </p>
