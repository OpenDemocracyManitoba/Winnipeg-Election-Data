class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I ran last election and had decided to forego the aggravation, but the emergence of Robert-Falcon Ouellette has energized me and raised my hopes that this city CAN survive the mismanagement and boondoggles that waste so much of our resources.  Ouellette will need allies and supporters at City Hall if he is to re-build the integrity of, and belief in City Hall.  Also I&#39;m fed-up with the negativity and &quot;good enough for Winnipeg&#39; attitude of the present council.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>Music is a collaborative art form.  I made a living as a collaborator in projects that were far bigger than myself and in which I had to understand the larger objectives and focus of the leaders in those productions.
Teaching is an art form too!  Teaching is all about helping others realize their abilities and potentials.  Winnipeg needs both collaborative workers and inspirational leadership.</p>

<p>The only thing keeping Winnipeg from reaching its potential as both a place to live and a place to work is the abysmal leadership coming from city hall for the last decades.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>First and most important is the resurrecting of BELIEF in the integrity and honesty of City council:  I will promote a NEW, CLEAR and ENFORCEABLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST contract to be signed by all City councillors and employees.</p>

<p>We do NOT have to wait for Provincial legislation.  We can adopt a new CONTRACT for Councillors &amp; Mayor to sign, and push for the Prov. Gov. to legislate as quickly as possible.   I have consulted with Mr. David Matas, lawyer of fine reputation, and he agrees that a CONTRACT would be a fine start in resurrecting the integrity of City Council.</p>

<p>N.B.  The Manitoba law Reform Commission has already done the work!  See their website and especially pages 40-43 for inspiration!
http://www.manitobalawreform.ca/pubs/pdf/archives/106-full_report.pdf</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The diversity of citizens, from high-density  Osborne Villagers to working people all over downtown to quiet neighbourhoods in Riverview, Lord Roberts, Wildwood and East Ft. Garry, everyone I meet is aware that Winnipeg is potentially a great city... lots of dissatisfaction with the present way things are going!</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>A mayoral candidate, David Sanders has, on his one dime, been at City Hall for two years EXPOSING the problems this city faces that are created by the mismanagement etc. at City Hall.
QUESTIONS:<br>
           How is it possible ONE citizen can expose MORE of the problems at City Hall that ALL of the incumbent councillors together?
           Are councillors elected to represent the needs and interests of the citizens and city?   or ??????</p>
