class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I am seeking re-election to the Pembina Trails School Board. I have always been a strong advocate for the public education system and wish to continue working for the students and families in Charleswood as their representative on the Board. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>My background in education has complimented my role as a School Trustee. I have taught in the North, in a rural community and in Winnipeg in both English Instruction and French Immersion. I have extensive experience from teaching in the Early Years to being a Resource Teacher working with students of all ages, collaborating with parents and being on inter-disciplinary teams. I have served on two provincial advisory committees: childcare and curriculum. As well, I was President of the teachers&#39; association. My experience and knowledge as a Board member  coupled with my background gives me a wide perspective on issues. I have been in a position of leadership having served as Chair of the PTSD Board to being Chair of the Winnipeg Public Library Board. I also have shown my commitment to my community through volunteering for the Winnipeg Blue Bomber Flight Crew, the Charleswood Horticultural Club, Gardens Manitoba and Run for the Cure. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>The Board has developed three expectations for student learning - literacy/numeracy proficiency, engagement of students in learning and graduation from high school. These have been shared with the community and our staff/schools have been working to achieve these goals. It is a belief that all kids can learn. As Chair of the Human Resource and Policy Committee I was active in the revisions to the Pembina Trails Standard of Behaviour document &quot;Creating a Safe, Caring and Inclusive Learning Community&quot;. There are financial pressures on the Division from building new schools to providing professional development for teachers and from facility repairs to providing supports for children who are having difficulty. Budget development is crucial as Trustees do have to balance the needs of the system with a respect for the tax payer. </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Pembina Trails has a wonderful reputation not only within the province but also throughout the country. As a recent speaker said &quot;it is the rock star&quot; of divisions. The teachers, principals, support staff and senior administration always have the best interests of the students in mind. They are a group of very dedicated individuals who work very hard to improve the learning of all students. I represent Ward 1 that is a community of people that have pride in their schools, value education and are involved in the school system. I am very thankful to be a part of this learning community.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>As a long time resident of Charleswood I feel that the community knows that I have represented them, their interests and concerns to the best of my ability. I have attended numerous school events from assemblies to BBQ&#39;s as well as bringing greetings at graduation ceremonies to attending pancake breakfasts. I welcome questions - please call (204-895-4539) or email dizuk@shaw.ca </p>
