information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I believe its important to give back to the community and I feel I can contribute to enhancing our children&#39;s education.   My family and I have attended schools in the River East Transcona School Division and we have lived in this area all our lives. Therefore, I am familiar with the division&#39;s needs, understand the education system as well as the challenges that students and teachers face.   I have volunteered in the community, as a Coach and Convenor for Gateway Community Center and various charities all my life and I feel that serving the public&#39;s needs on the school board is an extension of that volunteerism.  </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>First of all, my career is in education .  I have also had several years experience as a school trustee in the past and understand the workings of the board and the division.  My background and experience as a educator will complement my role as a School Trustee.  My immediate family and extended family have attended or are attending schools in the RETSD.  Therefore I  understand first hand what the needs are.   </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I believe it is very important to form  partnerships between the school division and the business community, as well as other academic institutions. Meeting and learning from these important stakeholders will help us prepare students for future employment.<br>
Because there are so many careers available for students to take, it is necessary for the Division to keep on top of those opportunities.    </p>

<p>I have worked as an educator for many years in Corrections with both youth and adults.  Issues such as gangs, drugs, poverty and lack of education cause many to make bad choices.  I would like to bring this experience, working with other groups to come up with solutions to help our student to make the right decisions. </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The School Division is always open to talk to parents and members of the community to listen to their concerns and suggestions. Also, I have found our community always want to be involved with the education of their children.  This co-operation helps our division to be successful.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>If you vote for me, I promise I will represent the community&#39;s interests related to the RETSD.    If you have any questions, please email me at  olynikbj@gmail.com or phone me at 204 661 6440.   I would be pleased to talk to you.   Thank you. </p>
