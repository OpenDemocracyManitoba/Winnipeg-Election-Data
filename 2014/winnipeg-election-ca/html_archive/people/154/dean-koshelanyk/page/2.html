race</a>.</p><p>There are <a href="#recent_news">64 recent news articles</a> that mention Dean Koshelanyk.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a href="/pages/13/frequently-asked-questions#candidate_info">how we decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I was frustrated with current board and their inability to actively engage the populace in a meaningful way. I was annoyed at the destruction of democracy through too many closed door meetings and the rushing of key electoral changes through without proper consultation and I came to the realization that I am very well positioned to be a positive voice for change to get more people involved in the education of our children and to bring democracy back to the people.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I have an honours diploma in Computer Programming for which I recieved the Lieutenant Governor&#39;s Silver Medal. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve held positions on many volunteer boards in and around our area including tenures as President, VP Finance and Admin as well as several different positions as a convenor at Tyndall Park Community Centre. I have been the NWYS mini soccer director responsible for planning mini soccer for all of NorthWest Winnipeg  I have coached soccer, baseball, hockey, ball hockey, track &amp; field and basketball and have worked with players from all across our division. </p>

<p>My children have attended or are currently attending Tyndall Park, Prairie Rose, Garden Grove, Stanley Knowles, Sisler and Tec Voc. I know the administration at many of the schools on a first name basis and have regular interaction with the Senior Administration in the school division. I attend parent council meetings at two seperate schools. I attend division budget as well as some special meetings.</p>

<p>In short, I know our ward, our schools and our division better than most and I am very well suited to transition into the Trustee role.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Too much money is being spent on administration to the detriment of the education portion. We need to cut back on frivolous spending so that we can get more &quot;feet on the ground&quot; in our classrooms. Even though the provincial government as legislated smaller classroom size in the early years, we simply are not meeting those requirements. Our children are falling behind.</p>

<p>There appears to be an sustained effort by the current Trustee board to do as much as possible to exclude involvement from the residents of our ward. Too many closed door meetings, lackluster agendas and barely existent meeting minutes. Little proper notification of important issues and little time to discuss those issues. No apparent effort to involve the residents of our ward who do not have children. In short a sustained and embarrassing destruction of the democracy that we as citizens should be able to have. Together we will immediately reverse this trend.  We need to examine why volunteers and residents are getting less involved and what we can do to correct that.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The ability of the schools to be as inclusive as possible to children from all walks of life regardless of whom they are. or where they come from.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Without even being elected..strictly as a volunteer and having nothing to do with my campaign, I have been involved in meetings with schools and senior division administration totaling over 8 hours in one week.</p>

<p>Once elected I will work even harder to represent all the residents in our ward and division. Together we will work to get more people involved at all levels. We will give each other the tools to ensure an open democracy where everyone feels they are being listened to and to ensure our children are getting the best eduction we can offer.</p>
