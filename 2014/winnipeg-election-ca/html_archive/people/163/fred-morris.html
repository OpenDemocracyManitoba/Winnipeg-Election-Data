list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>After spending many years as a community activist, I feel comfortable asking all the people of St. James Brooklands Weston for the opportunity to be their Councillor. I successfully presented a petition about keeping the Eldon Ross Pool open year round. Although it took 2 years too long, I was active in getting the demolition site at 2093 Portage Avenue cleaned up. Also, I have spoken up on issues concerning the barricade at Logan and McPhillips, the problems dealing with the construction of the new St. James Fire Hall, safety issues at Mount Royal and Ness, infill housing issues on Parkview Street, and the over development of the Silver Heights Collegiate site. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>During my 18 years as a courier, I got to know the entire City. I have spent 15 years in the management of restaurants. As a parent and grandparent, I have seen the importance of proper recreational facilities. My life long passion for politics will help me be a Councillor.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>As we face a large infrastructure deficit, it is important that Councillors spend their Ward Allowances responsibly. I will stop all spending on bus benches, luncheons, advertising, periodicals, and service club memberships. The most important current  issue in our ward is the mess in East St. James. Although the various construction project were necessary, there has been little or no explanation from the City about why these projects have taken so long? Did we have several neighbouring street closed at the same time? </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The history of the ward . It is important to appreciate the efforts of those who have come before us.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>An immediate priority for the City is to monitor the Frozen Pipes issues. The statistics should be posted on the City Web Site twice a week every winter. If we have a recurrence of last winter&#39;s problem, it will easily  recognised by Councillors and put on the agenda of Council. Council and Committee meetings should be held in the evening in order to give people a chance to attend. Community Committee Meetings should be held in the Community.</p>
