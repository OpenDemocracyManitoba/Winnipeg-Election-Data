class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>In 2006 and 2010 I made a commitment to ensure Pembina Trails School Division offered a safe, vibrant and challenging learning environment for students.  Today, Pembina Trail’s students are performing well above the Provincial average and for the most part above the Canadian average.  I am committed to maintaining this proven track record and I want to ensure our school division continues to meet the needs of our students and our community. </p>

<p>Over the last eight years, there has been significant growth in school-based daycares, safety programs for students and staff, and significant major capital improvements to aging facilities, yet we have maintained the lowest mill rate (lower taxes) in the City or Winnipeg. While the overall Province appears to be lagging in student achievement that is not the situation in Pembina Trails.  Staff and students have made our school division a leader in educational programming and academic achievement. Through sound fiscal management, staff in Pembina Trails have the resources in technology and the support staff to assist in the classroom, and continue to deliver quality education so our students are actively engaged in learning.  </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>As a current Trustee, I work with our communities to ensure that our schools offer the educational programming and services that meet community expectations for student achievement.  </p>

<p>With four young children attending Oakenwald, General Byng, and Vincent Massey Collegiate in the Pembina Trails School Division, I have the opportunity to see the results and meet with parents, teachers, and administrators on an ongoing basis and can see the issues from all sides.</p>

<p>As an active supporter of our community and experienced School Trustee, I stay connected and have served our community in a range of ways, including:
Vice Chair, Board of Trustees (2012 – 2014); Governing Board Member - Winnipeg Technical College; Chair, Finance Committee; Chair, Buildings, Property and Transportation; President’s Award for Outstanding Leadership (2005); Outstanding Citizen’s Award for Leadership in the Community - Winnipeg (2003); Board Member, Fort Garry Ringette Association; and, President Fort Garry Community Centre (2000 - 2002)</p>

<p>As a graduate of the University of Manitoba, Faculty of Management (Honours), and an employee with Manitoba Hydro for over 25 years, I have a strong background in financial and human resource management that complements my role as a School Trustee.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Ongoing monitoring of student assessment data ensures funding is allocated to areas where it is needed to improve student outcomes.  Trustees must remain vigilant on efforts made to improve student-learning outcomes.  Currently, Trustees in Pembina Trials receive reports from senior administration on student learning assessment results and this practice must continue.   </p>

<p>Taxation is always an important issue and I will continue to ensure programming is meeting expected outcomes while continuing to maintain the lowest mill rate in Winnipeg.  The division is moving into negotiations in the next year, and this will impact the cost of education.  We need to set competitive salaries and be aware of the impact these salaries will have on the cost of education in the Province.</p>

<p>While our school division has made significant strides towards reducing the number of incidents of bullying in our schools, I believe we can do more.  Maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, and respecting diversity and individual ability, are paramount for a student’s sense of belonging and self worth. We must continue to support initiatives to increase student awareness of the negative impact of hazing and bullying activities.   </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>While it is hard to narrow down to one thing all the great things that are currently underway in our division, I would have to say that what I appreciate most is that parents and the community at large are so supportive of what is happening in our school division.  Teaching staff are always commenting on how wonderful it is to work in a division where their work is appreciated by parents, the Board, and the broader community.  It is truly exciting to be a part of the growth in our division, and the energy in our schools is amazing; I see it each time I walk into one of our schools to meet with staff.  The energy and enthusiasm, the look of engagement on each of the students’ faces, is inspiring and one of the greatest rewards of being a School Trustee.  </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>On October 22, 2014, let’s continue working together to build a strong future for our students and our community. It has been an honour to serve the residents of Pembina Trails School Division for the past eight years. I will continue to work hard with creativity and understanding to ensure Pembina Trails School Division continues to meet the needs of our students and our community.</p>

<p>I am dedicated to supporting education that provides students with the learning experiences and knowledge they need to develop their potential while in school, in order to assume their role as productive citizens entering the post-secondary world of education and the workforce.</p>
