class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I ran in the 2011 by-election in St. Vital because I believed our city needed a change of direction. It was apparent at that time there were deficiencies in the way City Hall was being managed. In the past three years the city has not progressed under the current leadership, but regressed. In discussions with citizens in St. Vital it was apparent that they were tired of what has been going on at City Hall. Scandals, fiscal mismanagement, lack of follow up and transparency, poor leadership and lack of infrastructure renewal were a few of the issues that were at the forefront. The current administration and the Councillor in St. Vital we’re not a part of the solution but the problem.</p>

<p>People across Winnipeg are motivated by change this time around. We cannot have the ‘Yes’ men and people with self-interests leading our city. The incredible lack of innovation, creativity and courage to move our city forward has plagued not only St. Vital but our entire City. I want to be a Councillor who will stand up for people again, be open and transparent and not place political partisanship and special interests ahead of the average everyday citizen.  </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>As a father of two, a longtime resident of St. Vital and recent board member of a local community centre I am committed to working with my community to build a vibrant, inclusive and prosperous city. </p>

<p>I bring the experience of working on Boards and Committees that address the needs of people. My work as an advocate for people for the past 15 years has helped establish a sound mechanism in which I can work from when dealing with citizen concerns. My diverse background includes working with First Nations Youth, Youth in care, Post-Secondary students, the inner city, a crown corporation and people with life challenges. This has furthered my understanding in working in complex and diverse environments. </p>

<p>I was a volunteer citizen for the St. Vital Health Advisory and Patient Health Advisory Committees and University of Manitoba Board of Governors. I currently sit on the Winnipeg Committee for Safety and Citizen Equity committee. I am also a University Graduate as well as having skills training as a Trainer/Facilitator and Business Management. These experiences provide me with a broad range of skills that allow me to innovative, creative and forward thinking</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Accountability and transparency are critical to building a sustainable city. These have been lacking at City Hall. There has been very little work to champion this issue. It has created mistrust in our Civic governance. I want to rebuild the trust and integrity that our citizens deserve. I will do that by putting our citizens first and push away favoritism towards political partisanship and special interest. I want to work with everyone and build a city that we will be proud of for years to come.</p>

<p>Sound fiscal mismanagement has been an ongoing concern for tax payers.  Why have our City Councillors including the incumbent in St. Vital been spending our money without sound judgment? How can we accept major cost overruns and scandal as a way of doing business? Citizens across St. Vital are tired of paying more and want quality services and follow up. They want our money to go back into core infrastructure projects. </p>

<p>Issues such as safety, back lanes, rapid transit, and snow clearing are also at the forefront. Citizens feel like they are being ignored and not provided enough services for the taxes they pay. Lets get back to working with you.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I appreciate many things about my home, the rich history, stories, community centres and green space. I have many memories of curling out of the St. Vital curling club and spending hours tirelessly working out at the Y and hours of biking along the Seine, St. Vital Park and down Kingston Row. Going to the great restaurants and spending hours at St. Vital mall after University classes. We have amazing seniors, great school programs and an incredible businesses sector that enhances our community. </p>

<p>It is hard to appreciate just one thing about a community you have grown to love. Living on Ashworth, Bonita, St.Annes and Regal you take in so much about our busy, active and growing neighborhoods. You see new young families making St. Vital their home. You admire the incredible legacy of our hockey and curling programs. You see the difference our community makes in developing our neighborhoods and the diversity of bringing new people into our great part of the city. </p>

<p>If there is one thing i appreciate more than anything, is that it’s my home and i would live nowhere else.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>We have a choice to make this election. Do we vote for the same status quo candidate who is a yes person to the mayor? Do want someone who will stand up for citizens when they want to be heard or turn a blind eye in favor political partisanship, special and self-interest? Do we want a Councillor who takes every opportunity to get their face in the paper? Or do we want a Councillor who wants you at the forefront of the community. Do we support incumbents who are supported by political parties?  Or do we want a Councillor who stands up for everyone.</p>

<p>This election is about saying no to scandals and fiscal mismanagement. It’s about saying no to over spending our tax dollars and poor political ethics. This election is about the future of our city. To elect the same political party supported politician will only keep us where we are. Winnipeg wants change and your current incumbent in St. Vital does not equate to change. I am asking you to vote for someone who loves this city and wants to put it back on track so we can leave a future for our kids and grand-kids.</p>
