class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I decided to run for Mayor because it was an opportunity to address some very important issues that would not be addressed by any other candidate: the fact that we live in a divided city. </p>

<p>This election offers all of us to come together as citizens and address some of the big issues facing our city. 20 years from now, our children shouldn&#39;t be facing the same problems, whether it&#39;s with infrastructure, the environment, or social issues.  </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Mayor?</h3>

<p>I spent 18 years in the military, and retired in 2011 as a Petty Officer 2nd Class (the Army equivalent of Sergeant). I was stationed in the 5th Ambulance at Valcartier, Quebec, and I oversaw 600 people, including platoon commanders, and was responsible for some of the base infrastructure. I saw what leadership was about, why having a plan matters, and how you motivate people to do their best by appealing to the common cause. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Mayor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>There have been three audits and there is an ongoing RCMP investigation into what&#39;s happened at City Hall, and people have lost trust. We need a Mayor who is focused on the public interest, not just the interests of their donors or supporters. I have shown transparency in my election campaign, posting the names and amounts of all my donors. The goal is to put citizens first, while still being fair to everyone else. 
The other is that we need a long-term plan for the city, and we need to follow it. Instead, we have planning based on a crisis model, and it shows in our infrastructure. We need innovation, good ideas, and to put the resources into those ideas.  </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the City of Winnipeg?</h3>

<p>The people really are friendly. My wife is from Quebec City, and when we moved here her family didn&#39;t know what to expect, but it has been a great experience. There is a great arts and music scene, a mix of people of all cultures, and it is still a bit gritty. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I think this is a very important election. It gives the people of Winnipeg a real choice to set our city on a new and better path. I realize that if elected, I will be the first Aboriginal Mayor of Winnipeg, and for many people in the Aboriginal community, that is very significant. But I know, and the Aboriginal community knows, that we can&#39;t do it alone. I grew up in poverty, but now I live in the suburbs with my wife and five children. I want to be a Mayor for everyone.  </p>
