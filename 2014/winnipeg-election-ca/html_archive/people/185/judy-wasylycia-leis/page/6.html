class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I have always believed that if you don&#39;t like the way things are, you should get out there and make the changes you want to see. For years I have felt frustrated watching City Hall shut Winnipeggers out of the decisions that affect them. That&#39;s why I&#39;m running on a plan to open City Hall to the people of Winnipeg, bring back trust in our municipal government, and tackle long-term problems that have plagued Winnipeg as a result of poor planning and management.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Mayor?</h3>

<p>I have many years&#39; experience serving my community, as an activist and in government. As a provincial cabinet minister, I was able to start a very successful program that supports non-profit organizations and as an Opposition MLA, I campaigned against cuts to child care. I also had the opportunity as a federal MP to serve as both health and finance critic, which gave me the chance to influence policies that affect thousands of Canadian families. ‎My knowledge and my ability to engage federal and provincial partners is something unique that I bring to the table in this race.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Mayor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>If elected, my top priority will be to restore public trust in City Hall. The Mayor and City Councillors must be accountable to the people of Winnipeg. I will end backroom deals for a few, I will fix crumbling roads and bridges, and will bring the services Winnipeg families count on, like transit, water and snow removal, up to the standard they deserve.‎ I will also work to create more opportunities, especially for young people, so that they can stay here to work and one day raise families of their own.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the City of Winnipeg?</h3>

<p>The people! Winnipeg is ‎truly an amazing community. We are a generous, talented, and diverse group of people who pull together in times of crisis and celebration. I have had the opportunity to meet  many great people over the last 30 years. Throughout this campaign, I have received suggestions ‎from thoughtful, engaged people who want to help make our city better.</p>
