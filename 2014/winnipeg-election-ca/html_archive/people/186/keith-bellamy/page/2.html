race</a>.</p><p>There are <a href="#recent_news">62 recent news articles</a> that mention Keith Bellamy.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a href="/pages/13/frequently-asked-questions#candidate_info">how we decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>Daniel McIntyre is a diverse and dynamic ward and residents are looking for change. </p>

<p>The vast majority of Daniel McIntyre residents are committed to making a positive community impact and are seeking a responsive Councillor with the energy and leadership to resolve constituency concerns, move ideas forward and strengthen our community.  They want and deserve an engaged and proactive Councillor, who observes and promotes consultative processes and takes clear and consistent positions on what’s going wrong in our area. They are also thirsty for a Councillor who celebrates and supports what’s going right – our arts and our culture, new recreational opportunities and a downtown that’s beginning to thrive. </p>

<p>I think I have the kind of skills, energy and commitment necessary for actively promoting positive change. It&#39;s why I am running. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I have been a dedicated community volunteer for many years.  I am currently the Chair of the Manitoba Arts Council and Chair of Chairs for the Canadian Public Arts Funders.  I have also been a volunteer with organizations such as Valour Community Centre, the United Way of Winnipeg, and the Manitoba Conservatory of Music and Art. I was part of the University of Winnipeg renaissance in the downtown and West End and as Events Manager, created the well-attended annual ArtsFest. I now work at the Winnipeg Folk Festival. </p>

<p>I live on Clifton Street in Winnipeg’s West End - a community I love for its amazing diversity - and have owned a home here for the past six years. I have a long-standing commitment to community economic development, proactive community engagement, volunteerism and the arts.</p>

<p>Throughout my career I have worked with creative, passionate, and committed people from every possible background.  I am a consensus focused, problem solver with extensive management level experience working in and volunteering with education, advocacy and social causes. I have experience in project management and a strong network in the community.  I believe these are skills that can support positive change in Daniel Mac. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Residents in the area want to ensure that our neighbourhoods are receiving their fair share of funding for roads, lanes, sidewalks and cycling routes. The number of our streets in Daniel McIntyre listed as in ‘poor’ condition is 11% higher than the average ward - This is a serious problem and it points to a diminished capacity by the current Councillor to effectively advocate for our area. </p>

<p>Many voters have expressed the need for greater reliability in city services such as snow clearing and public transit.   They want greater investment in recreational facilities such as the Valour Community Centre’s Orioles site as well as Sherbrook Pool.  </p>

<p>Residents are looking for genuine leadership to celebrate our diversity and address racism, and take aim at the root causes of poverty, personal security and crime. I have called for the municipal-provincial ‘Block by Block’ program to be implemented next in the Spence and Central Park neighbourhoods. This program involves the collaboration of police services and various social supports and has a successful track record of reducing crime and increasing community safety. </p>

<p>People are also looking for creative ideas and solutions, and calling for things like curbside compost collection and expanded cycling routes. </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Our diversity, caring and inclusivity!  Daniel Mac is a truly unique ward in the City of Winnipeg.  Just think of our neighbourhoods - Wolseley, the West End, Spence and Central Park - and the thriving mix of small businesses, arts groups, community organizations and cultures. </p>

<p>The cuisine and variety of restaurants, representing every part of the globe and in every price range, is unsurpassed, and is a testament to the entrepreneurial spirit that is so much a part of Daniel Mac.  We are blessed with artistic talent - more working entertainers and artists than anywhere else in the city. We don&#39;t like to see anyone left behind and we support one another.  We celebrate our various cultures and practices. Some of our major institutions and local organizations are doing truly great work in helping to build up our community - The University of Winnipeg, Spence Neighbourhood Association, and Daniel McIntyre St. Matthew&#39;s Community Association, for instance.  Our area is truly vibrant!</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>We need a new generation of voices, ideas and energy at City Hall. </p>

<p>I strongly believe in a collaborative approach to addressing civic issues and my most important pledge is to consult and listen and work with residents to find practical solutions to neighbourhood challenges. I think it is critical to create trust with citizens by acting in a transparent and accessible manner. I would create a functioning and up to date Website so that I can immediately begin to communicate the goings on at City Hall with the Daniel McIntyre community. I will also post my Councillor expenses and grants on-line. </p>
