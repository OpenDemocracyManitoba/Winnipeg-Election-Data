class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I am running in this election because there is something seriously wrong at City Hall.  The land swap deal, fire hall scandal, cost overruns and the numerous audits tell the scary state of affairs at City Hall.  The residents in our city no longer trust the current councillors and administration to look after our city.  My job when elected will be to restore transparency, accountability, trust, implement a long term plan to fix our roads and to reduce wasteful spending.  This will not be easy; but it is something that I look forward to.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I have a strong construction background (Journeyman Carpenter) and an understanding of what needs to be done in our city.   I have also had training in accounting which I consider to be a very good asset.  I am open, honest and more importantly an independent thinker.  Qualities that I am sure we can use at City Hall.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Where to start...  Roads, transparency, communication, snow clearing, and brown water.  We have to get a plan for fixing our roads and stick to it.  Transparency is vitally important as it should lead to accountability.  Communication is important because the residents in my Ward would like to be kept informed and have a say in what happens at City Hall.  Snow clearing has to improve as side walks and  back lanes in some areas were cleaned poorly or infrequently.  Brown water is an issue for some in our Ward and I would like to find a solution.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I appreciate all the parks that we have in our Ward.  I spend a lot of time in our parks with my grandson.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am the only candidate that ran in the last civic election in our Ward.  I placed a strong second place.  I look forward to knocking on doors year round if elected.  I will post updates monthly at large apartments and our community clubs.  I will also have meetings twice a year at the community clubs to sum up the past 6 months and to cover events coming up in our ward and our city.</p>
