class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>My vision is to see Winnipeg become an ever more vibrant and healthy place for people and business to thrive: a city where people connect with one another and feel they belong.<br>
There is much more that needs to be done to address our transportation &amp; infrastructure needs  as well as strengthen neigbhourhood planning, recreational facilities, sustainability and green space.  I believe my energy, experience and vision will help support the new council and our community to move our city forward.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>My background as a community health nurse and a mother of three compliments my 16 years of experience as an active, vocal and hardworking member of City Council.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I am an avid supporter of improving public transit, active transportation and the pedestrian environment.    I will continue to champion neighbourhood planning to help guide new development while protectiong the character of our older neighbourhoods.  I also believe we must work with other partners to tackle the issue the lack of affordable rental accommodation and  the issue of  homelessness in our city. Downtown revitalization including securing a downtown grocery story and continued growth of our downtown residential population is essential for the health of the city as a whole.   I have been a strong advocate for ethical and accountable government and will continue to work for changes to our current system to ensure more openness and to restore public trust.  I believe we must do more to address climate change at the local level and steward our greenspace and environment.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Fort Rouge - East Fort Garry is blessed with active and engaged residents and a strong volunteer spirit.  We also have a gorgeous tree canopy and a valuable array of heritage buildings and beautiful public spaces.</p>
