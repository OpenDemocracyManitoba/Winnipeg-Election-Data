class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I have decided to run for Council because I am committed to the ongoing revitalization of St. James-Brooklands-Weston. I&#39;ve dedicated my life to serving people and doing what I can to improve our community. I have served and still serve on many volunteer community boards in St. James-Brooklands. I can and will work in collaboration with others to ensure that St. James-Brooklands-Weston continues to be a desirable place to work, live and play for future generations. We will achieve this through continued investment in infrastructure, community clubs, playgrounds, etc. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I have served on many and varied community boards including (but not limited to), St. James-Assiniboia 55+ Centre, Silver Heights Community Club, Sturgeon Heights Community Club Building Committee for the construction of our new club, Special Liaison between Portage Trail Soccer Club and City of Winnipeg, Winnipeg Airports Authority Advisory Committee on the Environment.  I co-initiated the launch of a Winnipeg Harvest Food Bank in west Winnipeg that serves more than 70 families every two weeks; and I helped launch the &quot;Westgrove in Bloom&quot; community garden project, serving the residents of a Manitoba Housing complex in west Winnipeg.</p>

<p>Throughout two decades of pastoring congregations  I have served and worked with people from across the socio-economic, political spectrum. I have set, managed and dispersed annual organizational budgets.</p>

<p>The experiences gained serving in my work and on the aforementioned boards have provided me with the ability to work with others to enhance the quality of life for the people of St. James-Brooklands-Weston.  </p>

<p>I was honored to be the recipient of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Award in 2013 for Outstanding Community Service and the Community Service Volunteer of the Year Award, Portage Trail Soccer Association, 2012.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Investing in Infrastructure. Many of the roads, sidewalks, sewers, and water mains are in desperate need of repair in St. James. Our&#39;s is desirable yet older community. As such, addressing our infrastructure deficit needs to be the priority for the coming years.</p></li>
<li><p>Openness and Transparency at City Hall. Taxpayers deserve to know what decisions are being made at City Hall and how our tax dollars are being spent. We cannot have a repeat of incidents like the Fire Halls scandal and the extreme cost-overruns of the new Police HQ. Council needs to implement mechanisms that provide open/transparent communication to the tax payers.</p></li>
<li><p>We need continued investment in community assets such as community clubs, playgrounds, senior&#39;s centers, etc. St. James - Brooklands - Weston remains one of the most desirable and affordable places in Winnipeg to work, play and live. Ongoing investment in our assets will ensure that our community has the amenities necessary to remain attractive for generations to come.    </p></li>
</ol>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>St. James-Brooklands-Weston has all the makings of an ideal community. We have a diversity of generations living side-by-side. We have new homes and older homes. We have great schools, a strong, well-established business and industrial community. We have many excellent community organizations served by dedicated volunteers. Our ward sits on the edge of the new Centreport, with all of its potential. The main cross-Canada route makes a line through the heart of our community.  St. James-Brooklands has a rich and proud history and a bright future.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I appreciate the endorsements of Outgoing Councillor Scott Fielding and past Councillor Jae Eadie. 
It would be my privilege to represent the people of St. James-Brooklands-Weston.</p>

<p>I ask for your vote!</p>
