race</a>.</p><p>There are <a href="#recent_news">98 recent news articles</a> that mention Suzanne Hrynyk.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a

class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>Maintenance of our limited green space has been poor, transit expansions have ignored the growing needs of those in Amber Trails, our roads are crumbling, our water is brown and our current city councillor is too busy to take phone calls from her constituents. That is unacceptable and rather than complain, I decided to do something about it and with the support of my friends, families and neighbours the decision to run for city council was an easy one.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I have spent eight years as a school trustee (2 years as chairperson) and 27 years as a registered nurse where I learned that an inquisitive and hands-on approach is how to get things done. I am straightforward, honest and when I don&#39;t have the answer immediately, I will always get back to you as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Every community within Old Kildonan has different specific issues, whether it is poor waste and water infrastructure, neglect for green spaces and roads, but the theme I have heard from my neighbours living in the ward has been that when people needed help there was no one there for them. I will commit to everyone in Old Kildonan that I will return your phone calls and that I will be an active voice on city council for the growing issues that are facing our community.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I appreciate the diversity of Old Kildonan. There has been nothing more enjoyable in this campaign than meeting with people from different cultural, linguistic, religious, and ethnic backgrounds and finding that common ground that brings us together. I have worked hard, visiting with people at their community centres, their temples and churches, and their cultural celebrations because I understand that it is important to engage with all constituents of Old Kildonan so that I can bring their concerns to the fore.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I have worked hard throughout this campaign to reach out beyond my comfort zone. I understand that if I win, I will not have 100 percent support from the entire ward but that I will work hard to represent each individual and each community within the ward with equal vigour. I have knocked on thousands of doors thus far and plan to continue reaching out to my neighbours and my constituents in the ward if elected because being a city councillor is a full-time job and must go beyond a 9 to 5, Monday to Friday committment.</p>
