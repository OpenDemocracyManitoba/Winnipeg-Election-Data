class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I have a 14 year solid track record of getting the job done. I&#39;m far more than election promises! I have been raising money for community projects, project managing and getting results for the community. I have raised $65 million for community projects – and in doing so have gained invaluable expertise and skills that I we need on City Council. 
I’ve gained extensive experience through my years being self-employed in business and in leadership and advisory roles.  </p>

<p>I want to share this experience at City Hall to give back and continue improving our community in south Winnipeg – St. Norbert Ward. 
My community work over the years has had a tremendously positive impact in south Winnipeg – St. Norbert ward and I know as City Councillor, I can continue improving the quality of life in our community.  </p>

<p>I’ve spent 14 years learning about the City / Province and Federal governments as an infrastructure fundraiser and activist, of all the candidates running – I am by far am the most experienced in these areas. This experience will serve south Winnipeg – St. Norbert Ward well.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I have a proven track record of getting the job done: http://janicelukes.ca/experience/</p>

<p>I am a trained infrastructure fundraiser and have raised over $65 Million for community projects. In doing this – I have gained invaluable expertise working with ALL levels of governments and funding programs (Building Canada Fund / Manitoba Rural Infrastructure Fund / Economic Stimulus Fund / etc) I have 15 years’ experience running a successful business. </p>

<p>I am an IAP2 Canada Public Participation Certified Practitioner with extensive experience in the field of public participation. I am a graduate of the University of Manitoba Asper School of Business Mid Management program and a Red River College Business Administration Graduate. 
I’ve worked with over 50 community groups in the ward (St. Norbert Farmers Market, Pembina Trails School Division, Parent Committees, Community Centers, St. Norbert BIZ and more) The experience of working with not for profits and volunteer organizations is invaluable.</p>

<p>Of all the candidates running – I am the only one that has brought community concerns to City Hall over 60 times. I’ve presented at every committee possible advocating for many of the groups I work for.  I’ve been recognized by many organizations for the community work over the years: http://janicelukes.ca/endorsements/ </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Resolving the student housing challenges in our communities around the University of Manitoba. The impact student housing shortages is having on the core fabric of our community. </p></li>
<li><p>Improving maintenance services being provided to the Waverley West community that is billed as ‘the cutting edge model of new urbanism’. </p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring the Basic core City services are provided (snow removal / fixing roads) </p></li>
<li><p>Efficient and safe transportation:  improving traffic flow, transit service into new and existing communities, and increasing active and age friendly trails transportation safety around schools and on our streets for all users, including children, seniors, pedestrians and bicyclists. </p></li>
<li><p>Recreational facilities: improving recreational facilities infrastructure and programming to accommodate the diversity of our growing neighbourhoods, with a specific focus on securing a South Winnipeg regional recreational centre and ensuring the completion of the Jonathon Toews CC field house. </p></li>
<li><p>Economic growth: working towards securing sustained and strategic investments in infrastructure to grow our economy, and focusing on a capital region economic-growth strategy. </p></li>
<li><p>Improving corporate governance and accountability at City Hall. </p></li>
</ol>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>South Winnipeg - St. Norbert Ward is one of the fastest growing areas of the city - but we must grow SMARTER and not jsut BIGGER. We must work towards a sustainable and liveable community that provides a safe and secure high quality of life, and efficient transportation system, robus economic development opportunities and social equity. 
I have the experience and proven track record of collaborating with multiple levels of goverments and community organizations to work towards smarter development and growth in south Winnipeg. 
I am very appreciative of the great cultural diversity we have in south Winnipeg and would be extremely proud to represent residents at City Hall. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I ask that every voter takes at least 10 minutes to look at the candidates websites. To look for the work they have actually accomplished in the community.  Politicians can make a lot of &#39;promises&#39; - I am more than promises - I have a 14 year track record of extensive community work. This work has brought me a level of experience that no other candidates has.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been recognized for my extensive community work with the following awards:
- Presidents’ Council Award – Manitoba School Board Association 2014 – Nominated by the Pembina Trails School Division Board of Trustees, 
- Queen Elizabeth II Gold Jubilee Medal  2012 – for outstanding and exemplary contributions to community.
- Premier’s Volunteer Service Award 2012 – from the Premier of Manitoba for  contribution to the quality of community life.
- YMCA‐WYCA Woman of Distinction Award 2012 – for unique contributions to the development of others in our community
- Active School Champion Award 2012 – for outstanding commitment and work in developing Active and Safe Routes to School in the community</p>
