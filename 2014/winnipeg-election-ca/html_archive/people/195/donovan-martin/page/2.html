class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I am running for public office because I feel city hall can operate better. As a long term resident of the Old Kildonan ward, I can see it has been neglected and ignored over the last four years. We deserve a City Councillor that is not invisible, has a clear vision, exudes confidence, takes the safety of our children and seniors seriously. A Councillor that is strong and engaging, one that will return your phone calls because your concerns deserves the ear of your representative. A councillor that is results driven and will fight for the Old Kildonan community.</p>

<p>Old Kildonan needs a city councillor that will be an advocate for their ward, not swayed by personal rewards or pressured by the connections that would further their own or their friends agendas. </p>

<p>My passion to run comes because I believe the safety of our community is important. I never want to hear another child or senior citizen has lost their life to a speeding vehicle in Old Kildonan. And I never want to hear the phrase “there is nothing I can do about it” again.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I bring a great understanding of business, risk management, insurance management, construction knowledge and a long history of serving my community. </p>

<p>• Long term resident of Old Kildonan. 
• Graduate from the Entrepreneurship Business program. 
• C.A.I.B designation in insurance &amp; risk management
• R.R.C.C Mini Soccer Convenor.
• Nomads Football Coach
• Immaculate Heart of Mary School Basketball Coach.
• Board Member: Political Advisory Board, Capital Building Development Fund, N.S.U.M  Board Chair.
• Large Risk Management for National Corporations.
• Insurance Risk Manager with over 1.5 Billion in Assets. 
• Committed to keeping our children safe and our streets clean.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I am a person of integrity.  The problems at City Hall of mismanagement of public funds; numerous costs over runs on projects such as the fire hall, museum, BRT, police station and the football stadium, could have been avoided by having the right questions asked at the right time. As a Councillor I will ask the tough questions that my community would like answers to.  Other concerns that have been brought to my attention:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Lack of leadership and communication from our elected representative at City Hall</li>
<li>  Safety of the community, increased crime, vandalism and theft</li>
<li>  Excessive speeding on residential streets putting residents in harms way</li>
<li>  Abandoned and derelict buildings</li>
<li>  Illegal dumping</li>
<li>  Road conditions are deplorable</li>
<li>  Lack of proper public transportation to service the growth of our area</li>
<li>  Lack of active transportation options for pedestrians and cyclists.  Not enough walking paths or sidewalks.</li>
<li>      Lack of proper recreation facilities for our four legged family members.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am not a yes man! Special interest groups or organized labour councils that indicate they control the councillors are not endorsing me. I will serve and be accountable to all the people of the ward. </p>

<p>I chose to run in my community of Old Kildonan because we deserve better. We deserve a councillor who has lived in Old Kildonan and knows the problems we are facing. </p>

<p>I am always accessible, I am available to sit down one on one, but I understand the demands on peoples time so I also embrace technology and the various methods of communication such as phone calls, Facebook, Twitter and, email through my website. I will not be a councillor who is invisible. When you call me, I will call you back!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I take all safety concerns seriously.  I am a councillor that can provide sound measurable solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>I will not waste taxpayer’s money by running multiple ward offices when ward allowances can be invested into our community.</p></li>
<li><p>I will not take money set aside to improve our community and give it to special interest projects in wards of other councillors.</p></li>
