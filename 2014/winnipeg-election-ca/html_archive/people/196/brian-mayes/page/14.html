class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>My wife reminds me that when we met more than two decades ago, I talked about my passion for justice.  I believe in the power of democracy.  I have had the honour of serving St. Vital as City Councillor since 2011, voting to almost triple the city&#39;s road resurfacing budget, securing new funding to asphalt gravel back lanes, and overseeing the construction of St. Vital Park&#39;s Duck Pond Pavilion, upgrading the St. Vital Library and Arena (completion date 2015), and Centennial Outdoor Pool, while at the same time protecting valuable green space. My decision to serve as councillor is the result of a decades-long passion for public service, ethical government and justice.  As a former economist, negotiator, lawyer and business owner I have both the experience and the interest in contributing to the community where my mother taught kindergarten, where I grew up, and where my wife and I have chosen to raise our children.  I am dedicated to St. Vital and to continuing this important work.  I have knocked on thousands of doors, and I have heard what St. Vitalers have to say. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>St. Vital is the largest ward in the city, and it has the largest number of gravel back lanes and other issues which we need to address. Having dedicated myself to the role of St. Vital City Councillor for the last three years, I know the job, I understand St. Vital&#39;s issues, and I have a proven track record of getting things done. I not only work hard, I bring to the job my experience as an economist and my ability to manage large budgets.  I have a bachelors degree in Public Administration, a Masters Degree in Industrial Relations, and a law degree.  I also have elected experience as a school trustee in Brandon.  I have worked as a civil servant and until I was elected as City Councillor in 2011 I worked for a decade as a lawyer.  I have owned my own business and I know something about the challenges small business owners face. I also have extensive experience as a director of the Deposit Guarantee Corporation of Manitoba and Workers Compensation Board of Manitoba. Given my broad-based expertise, education, and experience, I am able to understand issues from a number of different perspectives. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I have a balanced approach to issues and listen to all sides. I enjoy speaking with the constituents on the doorstep, at community centres, coffee parties, and at other events, and I have listened to constituent concerns.  We need to increase funding to improve roads, back lanes, sidewalks, water quality and curb repair.  We need to improve snow removal, including removing snow more quickly from sidewalks near schools and senior&#39;s buildings.  We need to continue to invest in police, fire and paramedics.  In St. Vital we have it all. We have diversity, vibrant businesses, libraries, and green space.  We need to continue to enhance St. Vital parks and protect green spaces, such as the Seine River. St. Vital has a deep history, and it is also cosmopolitan, and diverse, and we should celebrate that.  I will continue to promote and support infrastructure, services, safety, green spaces and the St. Vital community.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>It&#39;s difficult to single out one thing in a ward where I have such deep family ties.   If I had to choose one thing in particular that I appreciate it would be the mix of the old and new in St. Vital.  The St. Vital Museum is a cherished gem, along with the Mustangs, the Curling Club and so many other things. But we also have new landmarks, like the Hindu Temple, the Seine River Walking Trail and Le centre scolaire Léo-Rémillard. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Constituents know that I work hard.  I&#39;ve knocked on many doors multiple times not only during the campaign but also in the last three years.  I am interested to hear and address constituent concerns.  This is the reason I decided to run in 2011 and that I am running again.  I have the experience, education, and expertise to do the job. It&#39;s fun to reconnect with former teachers, classmates, co-workers, and even babysitters, who still live in the ward.  And despite the rain, and cold so severe my hands were bleeding when I door-knocked last March, this has been a thoroughly rewarding and exciting process.  I enjoy meeting people, hearing concerns, and in a small way contributing to the community that I love.  I hope on Wednesday, October 22, you will consider voting for Brian Mayes, the second name on the ballot.  I will work hard for my constituents, I will budget responsibly, I will listen, and I will be engaged because I live in St. Vital and I love this ward.</p>
