class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I want to represent St. Norbert because I know the important role civic politicians play in people’s lives. I want to be the voice for change for our community at City Hall and give St. Norbert the strong and trusting voice it deserves.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I have over 20 years of real experience building relationships seeking positive solutions. Through my entrepreneurial background and the leadership roles I have taken on, I have consistently demonstrated that I am able to work with all levels of government and stakeholders to act in the best interest of the community.</p>

<p>I am someone who has always taken the lead in working towards positive solutions for my community. When we needed daycare space, I saw the need to volunteer my time to work with my fellow neighbours to bring about improvements. Wanting to give back to our local Victoria General Hospital, I developed my own charity to raise funds. Wanting to effect real change in our downtown, I took on the role of Winnipeg Downtown BIZ Chair, so that I could actually make a difference by assisting in the establishment of the BIZ Patrol to help improve safety. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Some of the major challenges facing St. Norbert include: 
·      Repairing our roads and fixing our potholes
·      Investing in active transportation and cycling options
·      Creating recreation opportunities for our seniors and young people
·      Improving fire protection and neighbourhood safety
·      Supporting new and expanded schools and additional child care spaces for families
·      Completing the rapid transit connection to our community</p>

<p>In addition to these pressing issues my community faces, my neighbours, fellow community members, friends and family have all approached me about the lack of trust they feel with our current city council. I see that trust as the foundation of all other work that our civic representatives are engaged in. Rebuilding the public&#39;s trust with City Hall and their councillor in St. Norbert will be my number one priority once I&#39;m elected on Oct. 22.  </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The ward of St. Norbert is one of the largest in Winnipeg with historic roots and significant growth in southwest Winnipeg. Within these boundaries exists a tremendous amount of diversity that cuts across economic, social and cultural lines. There is also no sign of slow down; as Winnipeg&#39;s population continues to steadily grow, so will St. Norbert’s. This reality means the need to support our community centres, infrastructure and services will continue and become even more important as we look towards the future.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am humbled by the support I have received my community. People have been more than willing to speak their minds with me and talk about the future. This confirms my belief that our next city councillor will need to be a fresh voice that represents the entire ward and bring the change we need to City Hall. I believe that I can be that voice for St. Norbert.</p>
