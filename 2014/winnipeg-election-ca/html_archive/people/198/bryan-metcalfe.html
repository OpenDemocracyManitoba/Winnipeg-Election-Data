class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>When the current Councillor decided not to run again, I saw this as an opportunity to continue serving the community where my relatives and many friends live in a new capacity.  As a person who was raised, lives and works in St. James, it would be a pleasure to be able to use my Accounting and Finance education and work experience to represent my community in City Council.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>Living and working in St. James as the Executive Director for the St. James Business Improvement Zone, Trustee for the St. James-Assiniboia School Division and past Executive Director for the St. James Assiniboia 55+ Centre has been very beneficial in helping me learn more about the residents and our issues.  My previous positions of business leadership as Past Chair for Junior Achievement Manitoba, Past President of Woodhaven Community Club and past publisher and GM of Canstar Community Newspapers has assisted me in working and building relationships with the businesses and organizations that are a part of this area.  I believe my combination of business education and over 25+ years of business experience will serve me well in representing our ward in City Council.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>In speaking with residents of the community, they are concerned with the poor condition of a number of our streets and infrastructure.  I would like to stand as a Councillor that gives this important community issue the attention it deserves to begin fixing this situation.  I believe that striking a balance between maintaining and investing in road infrastructure is important.  It will come down to how much can be done of either maintaining or investing and how fast to keep the impact on taxes reasonable.  When fixing any roadway project, it should be analyzed for the potential inclusion of active transportation features.  The City has a plan laid out for Transit friendly development and that should be used to guide infrastructure.  Making the city more pedestrian and cycling friendly will provide good return on investment.  </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I appreciate how many of my family and friends have chosen to stay in St. James to raise their families and what St. James means to them.  Representing a ward that is filled with so many people that I know makes this an exciting and important opportunity. </p>
