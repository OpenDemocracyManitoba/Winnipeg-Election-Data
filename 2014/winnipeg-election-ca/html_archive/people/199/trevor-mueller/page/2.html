candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>The amount of corruption and lack of transparency in City Hall, has left a lot of people with a bad taste in their mouths.  We need good honest people in City hall. No more back room deals! Recent events in the city, has drawn me now to focus on helping bring the voice of the neighborhood back into the forefront. There is no city without community; there is no community without you and I working together.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I am a long time resident of Winnipeg. My home is in the heart of the Mynarski ward. I am employed as a construction surveyor, and have helped build many of Winnipeg&#39;s newest structures from the most prominent to the most important community centers and skate parks.
I have received training in Financial Planning, Human Resource Management, Volunteer Management and Board Development</p>

<p>In my spare time I am an active volunteer and help out in the community where I can even if it&#39;s just returning the neighbours dog.  For almost 20 years I&#39;ve served with CASARA Winnipeg, a search and rescue unit assisting the police and military, the last +5 years of which I have been on its board.  Locally I have spent time on the board of District #3 CFCA, helped start and run the new Faraday Residents Association and am working on various community supports here as well.  Most recently I have begun working with a human rights group here in Winnipeg.</p>

<p>I want to continue building community and help bring the voice of our neighbors back into the forefront of government.  They must be accountable to you everyday, not just during elections.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Open Government:  Citizens have the right to access the documents and proceedings to allow for effective public oversight.</p>

<p>Transparent Government:  Administration will disclose information rapidly in forms that the public can readily find and use.</p>

<p>Accountable Government: Acknowledgment and assumption of responsibility for actions, decisions, and policies.</p>

<p>Collaborative and Participatory Government:  Public engagement ultimately enhances Government effectiveness to improve the quality of its decisions and benefits for all citizens.</p>

<p>Newsletters:  Mayor and Council should regularly report on actions taken and individual votes</p>

<p>Roads and Infrastructure: Modernization and replacement in Mynarski</p>

<p>Public Transit:  Safe and efficient for the entire city, with increased Cadets presence and a Passenger Alarm system.</p>

<p>Drop in Centers : Open 24 hrs in every ward, increased funding for counselling and telephone help lines.</p>

<p>Clean Water:  Modernization of our water lines for water we drink and use</p>

<p>Safe Neighborhoods: Increase in community policing and community involvement.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The people, the people, the people!!!!!   Most times in the news, the North End, gets a bad wrap!  What they don’t see is just how amazing the people here really are.  We are a resilient bunch.  There are many diverse cultural groups.  It is truly a wonderful place to live.  I actually know my neighbors and we help each other out.  Can the rest of the city say the same?</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>AS  A  CANDIDATE  I  ASK  YOU THE VOTER:</p>

<pre><code>      -  ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE NOW?

      -  DO YOU  THINK  THINGS  ARE  GOING  TO  CHANGE  BY THEMSELVES?

      -  ARE ANY OF YOUR CONCERNS EVEN  BEING  ADDRESSED  OR  REPLIED  TO?

      -  IS ANY CITIZEN S&#39; CONCERN LESS OR MORE WORTHY OF ACTION THAN ANOTHER’S?

      -  YOU ASK  ME  MY  VISION?  I ASK WHAT  IS  YOUR  NEED  IN  A  PRODUCTIVE  CITY?

      -  IF YOU SAID  &quot;NO” TO THESE QUESTIONS THEN  WORK  WITH  ME  AND  MAKE  ME  WORK  FOR  YOU !

      -  CHANGE CAN HAPPEN IN  CITY HALL, MAKE   ME  YOUR  ADVOCATE  AND  LET&#39;S  GET  TO WORK !
</code></pre>

<p>I WANT PEOPLE TO GO OUT AND VOTE, VOTE FOR SOMETHING, VOTE FOR ANYTHING.  WE JUST CAN&#39;T CONTINUE THIS ENDLESS NOTHINGNESS COMING FROM OUR ELECTED LEADERS ANYMORE.  WE PAY THEM AND WHAT DO WE GET, HIGHER TAXES, MORE FEES, LESS SERVICE   AND NO RETURNED CALLS!!!</p>
