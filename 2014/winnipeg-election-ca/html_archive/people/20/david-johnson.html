class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I am running for re-election to the Pembina Trails School Board.  We have a great school division and I want to continue to be a member of the Board and serve our community.   It is important to me to ensure that the Division continues to provide quality programming in a safe and caring environment through responsible fiscal management.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>If re-elected, my experience as a member of the Board will be my greatest asset.  I have served on the Board for the past three terms and am currently Chair of the Board.  I have also been Vice–Chair and I have been a member of all of the Board&#39;s standing committees as well as numerous ad hoc committees.</p>

<p>Outside of my role as a trustee, I have held senior positions in both the private and public sectors.  I have experience managing a wide array of governmental files, working with both elected and non-elected government officials.  My experience also includes working with community organizations and liaising with business and labour groups and dealing with the general public.</p>

<p>Academically, my background is in Geography.  I have a BA in Geography from the University of Manitoba.  I have worked extensively in the area of geo-demographic mapping and database marketing – skills that are helpful when making decisions on long-term planning.    </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>The Board of Trustees has played a major leadership role in establishing three expectations for student learning – that all students will be personally and intellectually engaged in their learning; that all students meet or exceed provincial numeracy and literacy standards by Grade 8; and that all students will graduate.  These expectations are being embraced by the Pembina Trails community.  I want to continue to contribute to the direction of this and other initiatives on behalf of the communities I serve and the entire Division.  </p>

<p>Other issues or initiatives that are important to me include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ensuring that teachers have the resources that they need to provide our children with the highest quality education;</p></li>
<li><p>Continuing to support and promote the value of public education;</p></li>
<li><p>Providing responsible fiscal management to ensure that our tax dollars are being spent effectively;</p></li>
<li><p>Lobbying the provincial government to ensure that local school boards are being adequately funded; and</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring that our schools are welcoming and that our children learn and play in a healthy and secure environment.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>We have a great school division with great schools.  Our children have incredible opportunities and they are excelling.  They are, in fact, exceeding both provincial as well as national test scores in all academic areas.  One area for improvement is that we need to do more to promote our successes and good news stories. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>It has been an honour to serve on the Pembina Trails School Board. If re-elected, I hope to be able to serve to the best of my ability for another four years.</p>
