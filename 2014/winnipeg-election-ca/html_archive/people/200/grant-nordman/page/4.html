race</a>.</p><p>There are <a href="#recent_news">156 recent news articles</a> that mention Grant Nordman.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a href="/pages/13/frequently-asked-questions#candidate_info">how we decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I love Winnipeg and I believe in the future of our city.  I believe that St. Charles Ward in particular is a great place to live, work and raise a family.  I want to continue building Winnipeg as a player on the world stage while looking after the day to day needs of over 14,000 households in my area.</p>

<p>We will have a new Mayor and many new Councillors after this election.  I feel that I will be able to use my eight years of experience on Council to mentor the newcomers just as I was mentored by veterans like the late Bill Clement &amp; Harry Lazerenko when I was first elected.  We will work together to get things done at City Hall! </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<ul>
<li> Eight years of experience as City Councillor St. Charles Ward.</li>
<li> 11 years as President &amp; CEO of the Assiniboia Chamber of Commerce.</li>
<li> 30+ years as a small business person in West Winnipeg.</li>
<li> 50+ years living right here in St. Charles Ward.</li>
<li> In depth working knowledge of the neighbourhood and the issues.</li>
<li> Capable, Caring &amp; Committed to a positive future for Winnipeg!</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I will continue my work: collaborating with the new Mayor and Council on projects that produce real benefits for the residents of St. Charles Ward.  </p>

<p>I will prioritize road and infrastructure repairs, keep taxes low (rate of inflation or less), and support investments that will grow Winnipeg&#39;s economy.</p>

<p>There is a lot of talk recently about <em>accountability</em> and <em>transparency</em> : I believe both are positive attributes for us to aim for as a City Government.  That said, some rival candidates appear obsessed with these buzz words, so much so, that we have heard little from them other than a misleading promise to &quot;clean up city hall.&quot;</p>

<p>I believe the citizens of Winnipeg &amp; St. Charles Ward want City Council to take care of business and move this city forward.  They do not want us to endlessly audit and debate in circles regarding our past performance.</p>

<p>They want us to fix their roads, sidewalks, back lanes and sewers ASAP!  </p>

<p>They want the best Police, Paramedics and Winnipeg Fire Department that we can provide!</p>

<p>They want better snow removal.</p>

<p>They want low taxes.</p>

<p>If Re-Elected to serve as your Councillor you can expect these will be my top priorities going forward!</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>St. Charles has been my family&#39;s home for over 50 years.  I know, and care deeply for the people who live here and I am personally committed to the future of this community.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>In addition to looking after 14,000 households in St. Charles Ward, I have served as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chair of the Winnipeg Age Friendly &amp; Seniors Advisory Committee</li>
<li>Chair of the Partnership of the Manitoba Capital Region</li>
<li>Chair of the Canadian Capital Cities Organization Annual Conference (Winnipeg 2015)</li>
<li>Speaker of Winnipeg City Council for 3.5 years</li>
<li>Acting Deputy Mayor for the last year</li>
<li>A member of every Standing Policy Committee of Council</li>
<li>Board Member: Assiniboine Park Conservancy</li>
<li>Board Member: Red River Ex Association</li>
<li>Board Member: Winnipeg Convention Centre</li>
<li>Board Member: Heritage Winnipeg</li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest thing I&#39;ve learned from my 8 years on Council is that cooperation and communication with the other 15 members of Council is the key to getting things done at City Hall.  Some candidates will lead you to believe that you can bully your way towards change and that radical shifts of momentum are simple.  The City of Winnipeg is a $1.2 Billion a year operation, with over 8000 employees, and you need 9 votes on Council to change anything.  I am proud of most of what we have accomplished together so far.</p>

<p>I humbly ask for your vote!</p>
