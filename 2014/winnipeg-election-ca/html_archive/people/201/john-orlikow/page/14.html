class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I grew up with my family in the Ward and have had the incredible opportunity to serve the community as their City Councillor for the past five years.  I have used my experience and skills to improve our neighbourhood including increasing the number of streets and back lanes repaired each year, replacing and enhancing over 15 play structures and recreation fields, ensuring the Waverley Underpass takes traffic out of our neighbourhoods and providing an independent voice on Council that introduced the motion that sent the Fire Hall Fiasco, Police HQ boondoggle and the Real Estate Audit to Manitoba Justice, beginning the process of restoring the public trust in their municipal government.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I know how to get things done for our Ward.  I have learned how to get motions passed that address the needs of our Ward and how to defeat those that are not in the best interest of the Ward.  During my career as a Conflict Manager and School Trustee, I gained the experience and skills needed for the position and my record these last five years are evidence that I remain an independent, balanced and effective voice for the Ward on City Council.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I stand for celebrating the uniqueness of the 20 neighbourhoods that make up the River Heights/Ft. Garry Ward and addressing neighbourhoods’ issues.  I already believe that this Ward is an example of urban living in which everyone is safe and welcome. The Ward should be residents’ first choice to live in and, by addressing local issues, they will continue to help us build an even better community.</p>

<p>The common issues that I have been addressing are:
-   repairing more streets and back lanes, 
-   protecting our urban forest, 
-   improving public spaces including parks and community centres, 
-   improving connectivity, 
-   getting traffic out of residential neighbourhoods,
-   in-fill guidelines to ensure developments blend into the neighbourhoods they are joining,
-   making sure that your tax dollars are spent wisely.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The people.  </p>

<p>The rich history and the people’s connection to their neighbourhood is expressed throughout the Ward as a pride of place which I will continue to work with to make our neighbourhoods even better places for families to grow up and stay.</p>

<p>The incredible talent of the people throughout the Ward is an amazing asset for me as their input and experience are always included in my decision-making process.  </p>

<p>This is why I created the Community Connections Strategy that includes “Listening Tours”, an issue and neighbourhood-based web page, E-bulletins sent directly to residents detailing issues that affect their neighbourhoods, numerous town halls and the establishment of advisory groups.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Much has been accomplished in the last five years as your City Councillor including:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Increasing the number of streets, back lanes and sidewalks repaired each year,</li>
<li>  Making sure an appropriate amount of densification of Academy Road reflects the history and neighbourhood’s love of trees but does not become the new Osborne Village,</li>
<li>  Creating two of the largest in-fills in Winnipeg that include residential and commercial buildings, green spaces and pathways,</li>
<li>  Making sure the Waverley Underpass flows traffic around neighbourhoods and is not an over-pass that would push traffic into local neighbourhoods,</li>
<li>  Making our playgrounds safer and more enjoyable by replacing and/or enhancing over 15 play structures and enhancing green spaces.</li>
</ul>

<p>My proven record working for you, my experience in getting things done for the Ward and my life-long commitment to the Ward illustrate that I am best person to represent the River Heights/Fort Garry Ward.  I ask for your vote to re-elect me your City Councillor on October 22, 2014. </p>
