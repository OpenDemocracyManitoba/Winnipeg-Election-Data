Council Ward race</a>.</p><p>There are <a href="#recent_news">520 recent news articles</a> that mention Matt Allard.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a

class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I have a genuine passion for my community, and I believe that I have the skills and the experience to be effective. I have lived in St. Boniface all of my life, I am raising my family here, and I am personally invested in the well being of St. Boniface and Winnipeg. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I bring a great deal of experience in community volunteerism, neighbourhood representation and in business. I have given my time and energy on a variety of local initiatives. I have volunteered at Folklorama, fundraised for the St. Boniface Cathedral and built homes for the community with Habitat for Humanity. As President of my residents’ association, I spoke on behalf of my neighbourhood, an experience I know will be valuable when representing all of the St. Boniface Ward. As CEO of the Francophone Chamber of Commerce of St. Boniface, I brought St. Boniface businesses together within the business environment. I fostered valuable relationships there which, as a councillor, I can use this experience to bring business and community together. Finally, as a small business owner, I know what businesses need from the city to succeed.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Our campaign has four priorities - the four priorities that voters have repeatedly identified on the thousands of doorsteps that I’ve visited. If elected, I will work from day one on the four priorities I have clearly identified over the course of my campaign.</p>

<p>The citizens of Winnipeg have lost confidence in City Hall. Accountability must be restored in our civic government before the voters can trust the city to tackle our infrastructure challenges in St. Boniface and Winnipeg at-large. We must find creative ways to deal with these infrastructure challenges immediately.</p>

<p>Yet these larger questions should not overshadow the number of local priorities that voters have identified. As your neighbour and your councillor, I will get results. I have a proven track record of bringing business and community together. Through my work with the Francophone Chamber of Commerce and my residents association, and many other local initiatives, I have proven that I have the skills required to bring diverse interests together to deliver the best results.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>What I love most about St. Boniface is our neighbours’ community spirit:
* Frank Capasso from Sage Creek, who is building a park for future generations.
* Dee Dee Budgell in Royalwood who is an active community volunteer, and my official agent.
* Lindsey Wilson, president of Island Lakes residents association, who stands on guard for his neighbourhood 
* Dany Robidoux from Southdale helps municipalities across Manitoba embrace the green economy
* Ben Brisebois from Windsor Park, volunteer and social media master on my own campaign 
* Dave Angus in Southland Park, who works for a better business environment in Winnipeg
* Mamadou Ka in Norwood, president of the Franco-Manitoban Society 
* Natalie Gerard, a new Canadian from France who chose to make her home in Old St. Boniface 
I love the diversity and community spirit embodied by just this small sample of our neighbours. I plan to channel this neighbourly spirit as your councillor.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>St. Boniface is my life.</p>

<p>It’s where, during my campaign, I met Mr. Roy who asked me: “Are you the little boy who used to run down this street? Your dad said you could run up to this pole, but you had to turn around.”</p>

<p>It’s where I fell in love with my wife Joelle at the age of 17. It’s where I’ve made raised my daughter, and where I bought my first house. It’s where I built my business, and where I give back to the community.</p>

<p>I hope St. Boniface puts its trust in me to serve our community at City Hall. </p>
