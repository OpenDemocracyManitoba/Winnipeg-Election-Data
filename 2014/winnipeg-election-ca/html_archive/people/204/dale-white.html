Douglas Council Ward race</a>.</p><p>There are <a href="#recent_news">23 recent news articles</a> that mention Dale White.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a

class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>A strong knowledgable, talented, well grounded councillor group can support a good Mayor and their agenda or buffer and hold a poor Mayor in check from damaging the City and it finances/Credit Rating. A good councillor group can enhance the platform for the Mayor by bringing their own viable fresh ideas to the table for consideration as well. I wanted to bring my expertise to the council table and see if I can be a positive influence to turn the City back towards good governance, be progressive but with sound values and cost control and put my experience and skillset to good use.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I believe my senior management expertise and leadership which was built from the ground floor up to Director level in a medium sized business as well as my budgeting and analytic knowledge,common sense, and strong grasp of civic affairs gives me the tools necessary to become a good councillor. My writing and speaking skills are sound as is my negotiating and debating skillset. With many years of business experience I have the ability to quickly analyze the pros and cons of an issue and come up with viable and leading edge solutions. I have an extremely diverse background in business and I have had up to 300 people directly report to me.I have had very diifferent and varied areas of responsibility over those years in various areas of the company. I was fortunate to be asked by ownership on many occasions to go in,analyze, find solution. then implement, reorganize/streamline and improve results by quickly picking up and running with it. City Hall will be another task similar to others I have taken on before but on a grander but still controllable scale.  </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I have a platform of over 70 items, many very unique and original, that will improve the services of and the City for the benefit of the citizens without costing a lot of money, have other items that will save money and many items to control costs as well. I also have an infastructure platform as well on how to afford to and fix our roads.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>This Ward is extemely diverse from suburbia to some very challenged areas with a huge multi-cultural melting pot which gives it a special place versus some of the other Wards in City The Ward also encompasses much of old Winnipeg and the downtown area which are posed for renewal now and in the next decade.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Everyone knows the City has it challenges and agrees that changes are needed and that many things need to be improved upon or fixed. My proven business track record, my knowledge of the issues, Civic affairs, my common sense, and my skills and knowledge base will play a strong role in providing the solutions that sets me apart from other candidates in the Ward. All candidates want to and are running to improve the City but not everone has skills nor experience needed to understand, develop a plan, and then execute to get the many tasks done that will be needed to be completed in the next 4 years . I believe I have a proven track record and I can hit the ground running if elected with a strong platform and will lead not follow towards improving the City.</p>
