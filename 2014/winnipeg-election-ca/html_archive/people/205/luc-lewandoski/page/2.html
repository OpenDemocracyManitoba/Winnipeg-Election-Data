class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I chose Winnipeg.</p>

<p>I was living in Brandon and there was a job offer to move to Saskatchewan right at the exact moment one came up here in Winnipeg. My heart brought me here and I have enjoyed tremendous professional and personal success since then, ultimately finding the love of my life and starting a family with her. It is not a decision I ever second-guess.</p>

<p>But if that same dilemma was presented today, only eleven years later, I&#39;m not so sure that it&#39;s as easy a decision to reach. That frustrates me as I want our City to remain attractive to outsiders. I want our City to remain attractive to those of us who already live here. I know far too many friends who have departed in recent years and I believe we need some strong leadership to address the issues holding us back.</p>

<p>And I also believe it is important that you can&#39;t just stand on the sidelines when you truly believe something needs to be fixed, as City Hall and our broken streets do now. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I have spent the last year working for another city councillor watching and learning how City Hall governance functions. I was there for all three of the independent audits into real estate, fire halls and police headquarters. I have experience helping residents through some of the infrastructure issues which have been plaguing our city including brown water, frozen pipes, and last winter&#39;s shoddy snow clearing efforts. </p>

<p>In addition, I have been actively involved in politics for 20 years as both a volunteer, organizer, and researcher. No matter the party, people who work to support our political system gain a keen insight into public policy decision making.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t start thinking about how to make Winnipeg a better city when I registered to run; I have been thinking, writing, and debating about civic issues for years.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>After a decade of megaprojects, the next large scale project must be street renewal. The infrastructure debt is very real and seen every day on our streets. This is the biggest issue facing our next council.</p>

<p>We need more seniors housing to help an aging population remain in our community. I will work with residents and developers to find solutions that fit with the character of our well-established neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>Transparency, fairness, and accountability must return to City Hall. We cannot let the scandals that have been unearthed over the past few years ever happen again. Senior city administration needs to know that backroom deals and massive cost overruns will carry serious consequences.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The strong inherent sense of community that each of the three communities in the ward have. There is a distinct feel to each of Charleswood, Tuxedo, and Whyte Ridge that makes me excited about the prospect of representing this ward at City Hall.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Its a cliche, but I have loved the time spent meeting the many people throughout the ward who help make Winnipeg the wonderful place that it is. The way people share their thoughts and ideas has been a terrific experience. I&#39;m running on minimal sleep, in a constant flurry of activity, and think this is the best job interview I could ever ask for.</p>
