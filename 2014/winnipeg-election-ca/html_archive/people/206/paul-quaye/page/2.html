list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I felt that it was time for a truly independent candidate to be an option for voters free of business, personal or special interests. (Other than the residents of the ward of course!)</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>To the role I can bring my 13 years of experience in municipal infrastructure product sales, design and project management.  I can also apply my goal setting and accountability ethics learned over the course of my entire 20 year career in sales and management.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Fiscal responsibility is a main one as it applies to almost everything we do in city operations.  Communication is major as well as that has been identified as a point of contention for the residents so far during the campaign.  I would also like to see a sensible, cost-effective solution to our transit issues developed.  On a local level, looking at our community amenities in the ward to see where improvements can be made for community centres, active transportation options and even dog parks.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>It feels like home.  That&#39;s because I have lived here my whole life.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am hoping that the voters look at all the candidates closely and decide based on fact and feel as opposed to partisan politics.  Also, I am hoping that everyone gets out and votes and if you know someone that isn&#39;t, convince them too!</p>
