Comstock.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a href="/pages/13/frequently-asked-questions#candidate_info">how we decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I am running to improve city services.  </p>

<p>Currently we face several crises in North Kildonan that I list in no particular order:  Contaminated water,  Crumbling streets, Police Station closures, Leased libraries, Lack of express busing, Inability to clear snow; need for more community club services (parent groups, clubs for youth, employability skills training), ill managed traffic flow.  </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I have worked with the construction trades, the retail industry, various social services; several educational institutions.  I have been a Coordinator/Chair with MB Justice, MB Children and Youth Opportunities and MB Tourism/Ont. Tourism; Carpenter&#39;s Helper in 3 provinces; a GM Manager with Extra Foods; Dept. Manager with Palliser; Store Manager CWB; I currently manage an all French library and represent the Computer and Library Techs as a Councillor for Manitoba&#39;s 3rd largest employer. I have been a Community Correspondent for the Herald since 2012. I have volunteered as a Youth Program Coordinator, Co-chair of the River East Neighbourhood Network and Firefighter.      </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Leadership: Our current council was not able to ask the right questions to save us millions of dollars in real estate transactions. The past ten years we have lived without Kilcona or Chornick Park, we have lost our police station, we have had constant brown water, we have sold off our garbage collectors, snow removers and street repair teams because no one could or had the will to manage them-the problems persist all the way from Shoal Lake to Lake Winnipeg.</p>

<p>Ownership: Why do we lease the Henderson Library from a leasing agency for $45,000 a month and why does that same agency donate money to our city politicians? We would be wise to own our permanent buildings for the same reasons that we own our homes if not only for transparency.</p>

<p>Community health: Our neighbourhoods need organized programming for families-there is a lot more that we could be doing in our NK Community Centers. I would like to see our neighbourhoods as active as possible.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The people of North Kildonan genuinely care.  I have spent many years in North Kildonan and will be raising our family here.  One constant since my youth that I have noticed is that so many families retire here for the same reasons they raised their children in this part of the city.  We are inundated with the natural beauty of parks and rivers, trees and sky. We are close to downtown but once home we are in our own neighbourhood.  We care about our public spaces as we care for our properties and we truly care for one another. As a Councillor it is important to know while we manage city policies to improve public services-we are protecting and enhancing this healthy and safe environment in which we live.</p>
