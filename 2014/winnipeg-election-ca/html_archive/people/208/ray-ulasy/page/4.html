candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I am passionate about my community and am proud to call Transcona my home, having lived in Transcona for the past 49 years.  I decided early on, in 2014, that I wanted to run.  Like many concerned citizens in Winnipeg, I was bothered by the lack of transparency, and accountability at City Hall, and especially our ward of Transcona.  Which amplified this concern was the fact that our current councillor has sat on the EPC, been the deputy mayor and chairman of the city&#39;s finance committee and would have been aware of many of the negative stories that have run in the media.  </p>

<p>I have heard many residents complain of being tired of Transcona being treated like a secondary project by our councillor.  There have been many complaints by residents of Transcona of a lack of communication with our councillor, failure to call back/email, and attend events.  </p>

<p>My priorities are:</p>

<p>Fixing our Aging Infrastructure
Supporting our Local Economy &amp; Jobs
Effectively Planning and Improving Transit in our Growing Community
Planning Projects On-Time and On Budget
Increasing Accountability and Transparency at City Hall
Being a Part of Our Community by being Engaged and Accessible</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I have served in the community for 25 years as President of the South Transcona Community Club, the Community Clubs Board, Native Women&#39;s Transition Centre, Rotary Club and coaching all levels of hockey.  I have sat as the Chairman of the Hi Neighbour Festival in Transcona for the past 2 years.</p>

<p>I am the Vice-President of Business Development with Legacy Bowes Group, and have managed budgets, projects, and human resources at every level.  I have run several successful businesses, including Superior Hockey Clinic which assisted in developing the skills of thousands of hockey students, helping them achieve their goals.  I was also the co-founder and co-owner of the former Team Canada Mixed Martial Arts now known as the Canadian Fighting Centre.  I know what teamwork means, having served as the Regional Scout for the Calgary Hitmen of the WHL, and know how to identify leaders in the community and foster their growth and development.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Aging Infrastructure - While Transcona will come to appreciate the new amenities we are receiving (once they are built), it does not serve the community well to have new amenities without having the infrastructure to support them.  Transcona roads are in horrible condition.  We need to get back to basics, and prioritize our road repairs.  </p>

<p>Having said this, I feel that many of the projects that have been completed in Winnipeg have left Winnipeg with a black eye.  Our project management/transparency/accountability needs to be improved.  We need the right people for the right jobs.  The Plessis Underpass is the biggest example of a mismanaged project in Transcona, and has left our area gridlocked during rush hour.</p>

<p>I would like to see a whistle blowing policy created and implemented.  Also, increased details on expenditures for ward allowances.</p>

<p>Being a Part of Our Community by being Engaged and Accessible - I would return the East Kildonan-Transcona Community Committee back to the community.  These meetings should be held as a town-hall style meeting as then residents could attend and be informed.  I will also return phone calls and email to all, not just a select group.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I appreciate the sense of community Transcona has.  Many of the residents are 2nd, 3rd and even 4th generation Transcona residents.  We are a tight knit community, and fiercely proud of our ward.  Transcona has many volunteers who do wonderful work.  This is why I am so passionate about representing Transcona, as I feel that for the past 4 years, we have been slipping away from what we represent.  Transcona has become more about development, and expansion, and less about community.  I would like to see us return to our roots.  </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I feel that I present as the best candidate for the position.  My experience in the community, volunteerism, education is what Transcona needs.  I would be a councillor for all the people, not just select groups.  I have spent countless hours talking to everyone.  One of the largest groups of people that have been especially outspoken are the seniors, who have indicated they are tired of the status quo, and would like to see Transcona under new leadership.  I have dedicated myself to the improvement of Transcona, and have been talking to the residents of Transcona to see what they truly want and need.  Transcona wants to be informed.  They want a councillor that will be visible in the community, and are tired of feeling like a secondary project, or being mislead and not informed.</p>
