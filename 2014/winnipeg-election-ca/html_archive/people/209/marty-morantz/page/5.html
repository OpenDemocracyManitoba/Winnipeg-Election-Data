class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>Winnipeg has been very good to me and my family. Throughout my life and career I have tried to do good things and to give back to our community. I see elected office as another way to give back to the community and to try and solve the many serious and challenging issues facing the Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge Ward and our great City.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I am a business person, and lawyer born and raised in Winnipeg. My wife Lisa and I have resided in the Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge ward for nearly 20 years, where we have raised our two sons.</p>

<p>I hold a B.A. in political studies from the U of M, and a law degree (LL.B.) from Osgoode Hall Law School.</p>

<p>For 23 years, I practiced law as a partner at a Winnipeg law firm in the areas of real estate, corporate, commercial, and wills and estates.</p>

<p>Since 2009, I have been President of Jernat Investments Ltd., a property investment firm.</p>

<p>We have made major contributions to projects like the Saul Morantz Building at the Simkin Centre, the CMHR, Community Respite Services, and the U of W.</p>

<p>As parents of a special needs child, Lisa and I have also contributed to the construction of the Variety Heritage Adventure Playground at the Forks, and have established the Nathan Morantz Autism Research Fund through Queen’s University.</p>

<p>I serve on the board of Community Respite Services, the Refit Centre Foundation Finance  Committee and Shalom Residences Assisted Living. I am a past board member of the Manitoba Families for Effective Autism Treatment (MFEAT).</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>In the Charleswood –Tuxedo- Whyte Ridge Ward I believe the single most important issue is traffic. Currently traffic flows through residential neighborhoods and down residential streets in an effort to avoid route 90.That is why I will work tirelessly to arrange for the funding required for the extension of the William Clement Parkway and the widening of Wilkes. We need to ensure traffic flows around residential areas and not through them. </p>

<p>In addition the City has a major infrastructure problem that must be addressed. Infrastructure is a key factor in both standard of living and economic growth.  </p>

<p>Accountability and transparency are also a major issues in this election. Citizens have the right to know how civic projects are planned, paid for and completed.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I think we are very fortunate to have the Assiniboine Park in our Ward.
It is an incredible gathering place for all citizens of Winnipeg and visitors to our great City.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>There are many very serious issues that the City must deal with including infrastructure, accountability, transparency and taxation. These issues will require a city council comprised of serious minded, experienced people that will need to make difficult decisions for the benefit of the City. I have spent over 20 years practicing law, and in business, and have the necessary skills and life experience to get the job done. At this point in my career I would like to bring my skills and passion to City hall to help make Winnipeg an even better City.</p>
