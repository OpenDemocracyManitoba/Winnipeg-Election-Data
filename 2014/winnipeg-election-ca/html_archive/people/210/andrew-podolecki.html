list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>As a Winnipegger, I became frustrated with how business was being done at city hall and how the issues that faced Winnipeggers was being ignored or being handled with only half the attention it needed. Instead of complaining, i decided i wanted to do something about it. Already having a passion for politics and wanting to make Winnipeg a better place to live i decided to run for city council to offer an alternative and to bring new ideas to the city. Ideas with forward thinking, independence, and sustainability at it&#39;s heart.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>Most of my working life i have worked in the customer service sector and volunteerism. With this, i have the experience of always having people at the heart of every discussion and always meeting the needs of people, especially for those who may be in difficult situations in their lives.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Sustainability, Accountability, Accessibility. Going forward ensuring that as we grow as a city we are doing so in these 3 fashions, to ensure they&#39;re sustainable in economic, financial, and ecological terms. </p>

<p>Other issues i find important are similar to those that Winnipeggers have been voicing, the concerns over infrastructure, transit, taxation, roads, and community centres. Transit is particularly close to me. As a child and even as an adult. Financial difficulties have made it hard to own a vehicle and i&#39;ve had to rely on Transit to get to and from work, and because of improper transit services, many employers would not consider my application for work, closing many doors to me for finding good work with good pay. This is a reality for many people today and improper transit services will only make it harder for people to find work. Proceeding with Rapid Transit, Night-owl Transit, expanded Sunday service, along with major overhauls of scheduling for transit and expansions are needed if we want to make our city more sustainable, and accessible for all. 1 Bus can hold the passenger load of 50 cars. Which does more wear on our roads? 1 Bus? or 50 cars?</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Very community orientated. Residents take pride in their neighbourhood of being suburban, and wanting it to continue to be a slice of an oasis in a city. We have numerous parks, trails and dedicated community groups that want to improve our neighbourhood. Many families can easily trace back their beginnings in this neighbourhood from well over 100 years ago.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I want to continue with my positive campaign and to always keep open ears to all ideas from residents to ensure we get the change we deserve.  </p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t let anyone tell you it can&#39;t be done.&quot;</p>
