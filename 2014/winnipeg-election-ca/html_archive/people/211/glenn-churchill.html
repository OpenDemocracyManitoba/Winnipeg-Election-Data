Council Ward race</a>.</p><p>There are <a href="#recent_news">49 recent news articles</a> that mention Glenn Churchill.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a href="/pages/13/frequently-asked-questions#candidate_info">how we decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>There are two main reasons I decided to run. 
First is the state of our infrastructure and the amount of work that is needed in the upcoming years to eliminate the $7 billion deficit our city is now facing. Being a Transportation Engineer will give much needed knowledge on City Council to properly assess and provide oversight for this work.</p>

<p>The second, and main reason I decided to run, is a huge disappointment in what has happened at City Hall in recent years. With policies and procedures not being followed, the mayor and his members of EPC (including St Vital&#39;s current councillor) voting against having real estate audits performed on questionable dealings with the new firehall, new police station and other land transfer deals and then even voting against having the findings of the audits reviewed by the Justice Dept at the Province, I had enough. I want to help regain Winnipeggers&#39; trust in City Hall, which is currently at an all time low. In 2013, 67% of Winnipeggers thought they were getting good value for their tax dollars. In 2014 that number dropped to 36%. Do we want the same people on Council? Time for change.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>My background as a Transportation Engineer would be invaluable on City Council. The knowledge I have of multi-million dollar projects and the oversight I would be able to bring to Council would be a great benefit. I have been involved with the design and construction of numerous regional streets projects, residential streets projects and many active transportation projects and studies. I was also involved with the construction of Winnipeg&#39;s Water Treatment Plant for three years.
Knowing how various infrastructure components are actually built and knowing what the cost is to do various projects will help avoid another situation where millions and millions of dollars have been wasted at City Hall over the past couple of years. </p>

<p>Having fresh ideas and not being influenced by any political party, union or business is the only way to ensure I do my job as St Vital residents&#39; representative at City Hall. Having ties to anyone makes you beholden to them and then those ties influence your decisions. How can a councillor be impartial when voting on contract negotiations with a union that is supporting you? That type of behaviour is partially to blame for the situation Winnipeg is in right now.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Given my background, obviously infrastructure would be my number one issue and specifically the condition of gravel back lanes in parts of St Vital. I have some realistic ideas to get all the gravel back lanes in St Vital replaced with either asphalt or concrete. I want to change the Local Improvement Process to reduce the amount of paper work required for approval and I also want to reduce the amount local residents have to pay themselves. I would like to change the 50% payment requirement to 30% or 25%.</p>

<p>I want to ensure the active transportation network is developed to full completion in St Vital within the next four years. The number of families, children, seniors and commuters would all benefit from an integrated active transportation network throughout St Vital that will tie into other areas of the city.</p>

<p>I also want to continue to improve our local community centres. St Vital is one of the largest communities in Winnipeg both in size and population. Support of program availability to all members of St Vital is a large priority as it enhances the way of life in the area.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>While door knocking I have found that no matter what area of St Vital anyone lives in, they all take great pride in their neighbourhood. The city should be helping to build up this pride. Whether it&#39;s business associations like Old St Vital BIZ, local elementary, junior high or high schools, seniors&#39; residences or family homes, everyone wants their street or neighbourhood looking the best it can be. When something isn&#39;t right or needs repair, people want to see action to correct it. Representing St Vital means dealing with residents&#39; concerns and not ignoring them. 
I want to help build on the community pride by representing St Vital at City Hall. I have lived in St Vital for the past 23 years so I know what the community means to people and what it means to my family and me.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am not associated with any political party, union or business. I don&#39;t believe that the civic level is any place for party politics. City Councillors should be completely independent in order to properly represent all residents of their ward. I have been asked many times which party do I support. I don&#39;t support any party. When I vote, I vote for who I believe has the best ideas at the time.</p>

<p>Having an engineer on City Council would be a huge benefit to the city. Infrastructure is Winnipeggers&#39; number one concern. The technical knowledge, understanding and ability to provide proper oversight is lacking on Council. I want to fill that gap.
I am running for City Council for one reason - to do what I can to help the city. I am not looking to further any political career. I&#39;m not a politician. I am in this for what I believe are the right reasons.</p>

<p>I hope everyone gets informed about their choices. Do some research and don&#39;t vote blindly. If we want change, we have to vote for change. Winnipeg and St Vital deserve better than what we&#39;ve received over the past few years.</p>
