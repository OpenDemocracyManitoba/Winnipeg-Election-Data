St. James - Brooklands Council Ward race</a>.</p><p>There are <a href="#recent_news">130 recent news articles</a> that mention Stefan Jonasson.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a

class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>The 2014 civic election in Winnipeg promises to be a watershed in this city’s history in which we turn the corner on an era that has been characterized by willful neglect and visionless leadership. We have an unprecedented opportunity to return a progressive and collaborative majority to City Council — one that can offer real leadership and purpose in making Winnipeg the most livable city in Canada. I want to be a part of that new majority.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>As an ordained minister, I have earned the respect of people across the continent as a trustworthy and progressive leader. In my work, both in business and the church, I have developed an expertise on governance, organizational development, conflict management, and leadership training. My roots in St. James are deep and I care passionately about our city, but especially the St. James, Brooklands and Weston neighbourhoods.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Restoring trust in city hall o ensure business is conducted ethically and above suspicion, while establishing clear guidelines for reporting to council on all city projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Rebuilding our city&#39;s infrastructure by developing a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate streets, sidewalks, sewers and water lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Supporting our public assets by investing in our parks, libraries, community centres and green spaces, while ensuring that our public assets are not sacrificed for short term gain and that citizens are getting value for their tax dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>Growing the vitality of our community by (a) working with partners to establish a farmers’ market in St. James, (b) expanding the development of splash pads and spray parks accessible to all parts of our community, (c) working with community members to identify areas for off-leash dog parks and green spaces, and (d) ensuring that Brooklands and Weston are integral parts of the life of the ward.</p></li>
<li><p>Making environmental health and sustainability an integral part of the planning process by requiring new developments to be environmentally sustainable. Having a safe and efficient public transportation system that serves the city as it grows—making active transportation and pedestrian safety priorities in the planning process.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>As a lifelong resident of St. James, whose family first settled near Brooklands in 1910, it is virtually impossible to name just one thing that I appreciate about St. James, Brooklands and Weston. So I&#39;ll note its rich history as a community. I grew up listening to stories of the early families in the area — the Bourkes and the Hallets, the Prudens and the McKays, the Bannatynes and the Bruces, the Isbisters and the Taits — and I met several of their descendants.  Our community has been home to several talented artists — Beryl Joyce and Clarence Tillenius and R.G. Pollock — and  they were preceded by L.L. Fitzgerald (of the Group of Seven) and Valentine Fanshaw. Seven generations of my family have lived in St. James — so far.  This community is etched deep in my bones and I carry it with me wherever I go.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>The sign on the road as you enter Winnipeg, which reads &quot;One Great City,&quot; is not just a slogan — it&#39;s a fact! Together we can build an even greater city that is not simply a wonderful place to live, but a progressive city that is the envy of people near and far.</p>
