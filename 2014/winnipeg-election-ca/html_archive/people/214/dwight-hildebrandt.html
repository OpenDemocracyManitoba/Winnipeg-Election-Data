class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>• Senior citizens walking on Portage avenue in the middle of traffic because the sidewalks were not cleaned.
• 80 pound ice chunks deposited on our driveways. I was told City Policy is if you can move one car out then that is good enough for the City of Winnipeg. 
• TAX FREEZE, What tax freeze the property has increased in value and our taxes are based the value of your house so our taxes have increased every year.
• Photo Radar, why is the amber light shorter on red light camera intersections? Photo Radar needs to be dismantled and studied if it is ever to be used again for safety and not for revenue.
• Our roads and sidewalks are not even being maintained anymore. They are the worst that they have ever been.
In the same way that Winnipeg leads the world in so many other respects (in human and women’s rights, in business entrepreneurship, in world-class talent, in charitable giving, etc.) we can build on this strong legacy to begin to run our city in a way that better serves its citizens, improves our quality of life, and makes us proud to call this place home.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>Dwight has strong and longstanding professional relationships with a wide range of organizations and individuals, whose trust and respect he has earned over many years. He is known to many as a person not only of his word, but also of action, and subsequently for his ethics and integrity. 
For the past 15 years Dwight has held varying positions of growing responsibility and complexity within the financial services industry. His current role is a Manager, Business Development, which is comprised of building new professional relationships, business partnerships and clients for his employer, an international corporate financial services company. Dwight works with individuals from every sphere of life and from every size of organization, from small ‘mom and pop’ style businesses through to huge, publicly-traded companies from across Canada and the US. 
Dwight’s experience in both the commercial real-estate and financial sectors has given him experience and keen insights into sound financial management, leasing and development practices, and considerable business acumen – qualities that will serve both the    St. Charles ward, and the city of Winnipeg well in this era of property scandals and pending rapid transit development. Volunteer – many decades of community and regional volunteerism </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Attitude change: 
We need to start treating our citizens as customers. This change needs to take root at the top and flow down to every department!
Money Management:
 We need a complete forensic audit done, the type that can trace every penny being spent. Only when we know where our money is going can we build solid plans. Only when we know where every penny is going can we negotiate the expenditure of these funds or the saving of them.
Encourage Saving: 
Currently there is a rush every year at the end of the year to spend all budget money, Why? Well if it is not spent then they funded the following year to the amount that they spend. We need to encourage saving while keeping funding at the same level even though it is not fully spent. This way departments can build up a fund which one day will earn enough interest that these departments will no longer need to be funded by tax dollars.
Streets and sidewalks:
They need to be cleaned and maintained!  </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The People!</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am the only privately sector employee running in this ward. The remainder of the candidates are employed by one government department or another with the exception of Geoff Borden.    </p>
