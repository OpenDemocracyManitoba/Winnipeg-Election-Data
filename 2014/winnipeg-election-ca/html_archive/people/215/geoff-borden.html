class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>Winnipeg needs councillors who don&#39;t have anyone to &quot;pay back&quot; when they&#39;re in office. I&#39;m not taking donation from business people or from unions â€” and I never will. </p>

<p>I&#39;m running for office for the same reason you would: because I think I can help make this city better for the people who live here. </p>

<p>My priorities are the same ones that I&#39;ve heard from my neighbours while knocking on doors all over my ward. People want to live in a Winnipeg that is fair, that is kind, that is awesome. But a single councillor is only one vote. So I&#39;m not just a guy with a few ideas and solid ideals. I&#39;m also someone who can listen to others and work with them to accomplish as much as possible, together. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not just electing me to fix the problems faced by the city right now, but to face the challenges that still lay ahead.I&#39;ll be the best councillor not because I have all the answers, but because I&#39;ll be the best at finding them.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>Over the years I have sat on many boards and been a member of multiple committees. I have experience dealing with executive councils and The Board of Governors at Brandon University. I understand the process and rules that are in place during these meetings and those in place at City Council meetings. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Winnipeg needs a bold plan to build homes for every homeless person in Winnipeg. This is possible. The state of Utah has done this and reduced it&#39;s homeless rate by 74% in the last 8 years.</p>

<p>The city could provide a simple internet service for free or offer higher speeds at a reduced rate to help lower income families gain internet access.</p>

<p>The Executive Policy Committee is not democratic. We elected these officials to their councillor positions, not to the E.P.C. They are picked by the Mayor, which can breed corruption.</p>

<p>I would like to explore a corporate income tax in Winnipeg and lower property taxes.</p>

<p>Stop paying companies to move to Winnipeg with tax incentives. Instead use that money to support &amp; expand local businesses.</p>

<p>I suggest that all ward allowances be pulled &amp; if money is needed, it must be requested during council meetings.</p>

<p>Bring all Water &amp; Waste infrastructure up to date. Remove all combined systems, so that we are not sending our sewer waste straight into the Assiniboine &amp; Red River.</p>

<p>With the increase in severe thunderstorms in Southern Manitoba, including Winnipeg, now is the time for us to build a Severe Weather Early Warning System.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I have come to love the St. Charles area. There are no large buildings obstructing my view of the skyline and plenty of parks and opens space for my son and I to enjoy.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am not just a representative, I am a resident.  I understand the needs of the many, not the desires of council and its political intrigues. I will not be a bench warmer. I will push for change at City Hall. I want to make Winnipeg and the St. Charles area better.</p>
