Charleswood - Tuxedo Council Ward race</a>.</p><p>There are <a href="#recent_news">34 recent news articles</a> that mention Evan Duncan.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a href="/pages/13/frequently-asked-questions#candidate_info">how we decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I&#39;m running because I care about my community.  I&#39;m running because I believe this city needs new, energetic leadership to continue to move us forward.  We need a new approach.  </p>

<p>I believe I can bring positive change to City Hall by being the kind of councillor that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>is accountable to my constituents by engaging with them and returning their phone calls;</p></li>
<li><p>who serves the best interests of the community not for self interest or political agenda; and </p></li>
<li><p>who works effectively with others -- both community members and civic administration -- to find creative solutions and achieve positive outcomes for the Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge ward.  </p></li>
</ul>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>What experience do you bring to compliment your role as city councillor?</p>

<p>I have lived in Charleswood my entire life and have spent the last 13 years working with local businesses, community centres, youth and families in the Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge ward. </p>

<p>My hands-on experience includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Working to reduce and prevent neighborhood crime as a drop-in coordinator at Westdale and River West Park schools</p></li>
<li><p>Providing effective and affordable community services for young families as a volunteer coach and program coordinator for community hockey teams (such as the Charleswood Hawks, Roblin Park Raiders, Oak Park Raiders and Varsity View Falcons)</p></li>
<li><p>Establishing positive working relationships with local businesses, provincial government representatives, parents and community organizations as an educational assistant with the Pembina Trails School Division and fundraiser for local community groups</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am currently employed as a Juvenile Counsellor with Manitoba Justice and serve as a Board Member for the Charleswood Hawks Hockey Club. </p>

<p>My connections to this community are based on real relationships forged through hard work and results.  My experience shows that I can work effectively with others and achieve positive outcomes with limited resources. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Accountability - councillors returning phone calls and emails personally to constituents and communicating with residents on issues that affect them.  Our leaders are elected to serve the people and not self interests or political agenda. I care about this great community. I will be a councillor who is in touch with the community and goes to work every day with the community&#39;s best interest at heart. </p>

<p>Stopping wasteful spending - I will work to find creative solutions to our fiscal crisis by making tough decisions on priorities in this city and finding creative solutions. The old model of doing things is not working.</p>

<p>Making responsible development decisions - New developments can be the catalyst to invoke positive progress within our community. If planned and developed properly, they can help upgrade our streets and sewers while improving upon our current traffic flow and road safety concerns. </p>

<p>These decisions need to be made responsibly because they will change the landscape of our community. Development needs to reflect the qualities that make our community great, including: parks, green spaces and safe and quiet streets. They need to be done right and made for the right reasons, not for private or political benefit.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The people.  I have had the opportunity to meet and work with so many different community organizations and individuals both in my previous experience and as part of this campaign.  I am consistently inspired by the level and calibre of commitment they bring to their neighbourhoods, neighbours, children, and the issues that affect them.  Like me, people are invested in this ward.  They engage with their neighbours through community club events and fundraisers, set an example for active living by taking advantage of our green infrastructure like the Assiniboine Forest and Fort Whyte Alive trail, respect their neighbourhoods by taking pride in their property, and engage with local government by taking the time to make their voices heard.   People want the best for their families and this community because this is where they live and this is where they are going to stay.  They expect and deserve a councillor that understands that and feels the same way.  I am excited and humbled by the opportunity to represent the people in Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge.  </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>This city needs vision and it needs someone who can not only lead that vision but represent those that it affects.  Politics loom large in elections, but representing you isn&#39;t about politics.  This community deserves more than that.  It deserves a leader who understands the issues in our community, who draws on our community organizations for information and insight, and who has a proven track record of being able to work with people to achieve real results.  I believe I am that leader and I am asking for your support on October 22 so that we can improve this ward and move this city forward together.  </p>
