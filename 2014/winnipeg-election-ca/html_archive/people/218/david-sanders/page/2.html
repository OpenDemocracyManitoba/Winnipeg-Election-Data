class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I have observed City Hall since 1965, when I was Metro and City Hall Reporter for the Winnipeg Tribune. Most of my subsequent career in the Provincial Government, serving twice as Deputy Minister of Urban Affairs, was devoted to helping make our City government work better. Two years ago I discovered that there was serious mismanagement and misconduct occurring at City Hall, especially among some of the senior administrators, and that the City Council was unable or unwilling to fix it. I began to appear at Council and its Committees regularly, asking questions, demanding answers, and offering practical solutions. By this summer it had become obvious that the present Council would not fix things. I looked around, and concluded that none of the other candidates for mayor would be willing or able to deal effectively with the situation now. Most had been nowhere near City Hall. Given my extensive experience, knowledge and administrative skills, I decided that I had better offer to take on the job myself, to overhaul City Hall and make it possible for us to manage our resources wisely once again, and make Winnipeg a safe, fair and fun place for all.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Mayor?</h3>

<p>I have 45 years’ senior executive experience in Winnipeg, as a lawyer, public administrator, management consultant, property and business tax consultant, university teacher and administrator, marketing manager and journalist. I worked in many different departments of the Government of Manitoba for 18 years, but most of the time I dealt with City of Winnipeg legislation, financial affairs, and land use plans. I have also been a national government computer systems marketing manager for Unisys Canada Inc., and a lecturer and faculty administrator at the University of Manitoba. I have served as a professional management consultant with a specialty in human resources management, and for the past 20 years I have been engaged in seeking fair property and business tax assessments for most major commercial and institutional property owners in Winnipeg. I maintain my status as a practising lawyer in order to conduct selected pro bono cases, in the public interest. Throughout my life I have provided active leadership for university, professional, school, community, sports, and charitable organizations, so I fully appreciate the character and strengths of our community. And I will hit the ground running, because I have participated in most debates at City Hall for the past two years.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Mayor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>As Mayor, I will lead a progressive majority of Council in taking action to achieve the following objectives:
1. End the mismanagement, misconduct and secrecy in decision-making at City Hall.
2. Restore public trust in our City government.
3. Reveal the full extent of the financial mess left behind by current and previous Councils, and establish a realistic plan to manage the City’s financial affairs wisely, going forward.
4. Restore and maintain basic City services and infrastructure.
5. Reconsider the justification and priorities for major projects, such as the Southwest Transitway, and proceed with revised plans for those projects which are most necessary and financially feasible.
6. Secure intergovernmental cooperation and collaboration with the federal, provincial, Capital Region municipal governments, and First Nations.
7. Curb the exorbitant costs of extending infrastructure to accommodate urban sprawl.
8. Empower citizens to play a much more meaningful role in City decision-making, always.
These matters are important to me, because I love Winnipeg and I want it to be a safe, fair and fun place to be, not only for my extended family, but for all Winnipeggers, now and in the future. We can be a model green, affordable, compassionate and prosperous community.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the City of Winnipeg?</h3>

<p>Winnipeg is the “Heart of the Continent,” as CBC weatherman Ed Russenholt used to say every evening, a very long time ago, and we Winnipeggers have really big hearts. We are generous with our time, money and talents. We are generous on a City-wide scale, as with the United Way, the Winnipeg Foundation, Winnipeg Harvest, and countless other charitable and non-profit organizations and projects. We are generous within our neighbourhoods, volunteering, coaching, fundraising, and working together. And we are generous with each other, with our neighbours, friends and families.
This same generosity of spirit extends to our willingness to support a full range of universally available public services in healthcare, education, transportation, recreation, libraries, and many other community functions, whether or not we use them ourselves.
I feel we are family. I know that not all Winnipeggers are able to enjoy that feeling yet, but if it is possible to achieve that goal anywhere, I believe we can do it here.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>As candidate for Mayor of Winnipeg, I believe I have the most extensive experience and training in government and public finance; special knowledge of the City&#39;s history, communities, businesses and institutions; a lifelong passion for serving to improve the quality of life of all citizens; and demonstrated ability to seek truth, fairness and justice, without fear or favour. I have been an especially active participant and critic at City Hall for almost two years, and I am ready to deal with the many challenges and opportunities immediately following the election.
I seek to champion a resilient green City, a youth-friendly and age-friendly City, a financially viable and responsible City, a respectful and inclusive City. Working together, we can be all that, and more.
At the Advance Polls, and on October 22nd, I urge all citizens to get out and vote for the school trustees, the city councillors, and the Mayor, and ensure that Winnipeg gets the government it needs now. </p>
