Charleswood - Tuxedo Council Ward race</a>.</p><p>There are <a href="#recent_news">27 recent news articles</a> that mention Nadine Stiller.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a href="/pages/13/frequently-asked-questions#candidate_info">how we decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I want to become Councillor for the ward because I feel strongly that City Hall needs to change the way it does business in order to make Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge and Winnipeg the best they can be.  I have the passion, competence and capability to make a meaningful contribution, a contribution that makes a difference in peoples lives for the better.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I am an experienced executive with the Federal Government who has directed large teams and managed multi-million dollar budgets including the delivery and implementation of complex programs and service delivery.  Currently, I am the Regional Director, Prairie Region at Public Safety Canada. Previously, I worked at Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada where I was a Funding Director, which oversees governments’ compliance with funding agreements and multi-million dollar budgets.  I have also managed environmental regulatory programs at Fisheries and Oceans Canada.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I support new development that is consistent with the surrounding community and that provides for a need in the community.  At a recent public meeting when asked a similar question I emphasized that new development has to occur in the context of the existing neighbourhood and that it seems developers are planning our city which is not necessarily in the best interests of the majority of Winnipeggers.</p>

<p>I want to help Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge residents work through controversial developments in a way that does not pit proponents against established neighbourhoods.  It is important to me because of my innate sense of fairness to implement a transparent community consultation process and objective city planning that addresses and mitigates neighbour&#39;s concerns.  </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge I think the most pressing issue is managing future development planned for the ward in a way that does not compromise what makes Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge special and unique.  Whether its the Harte Trail, Assiniboine Forest or the green space behind your house where you grew up playing we need to ensure a no net loss principle of those areas residents use for outdoor recreational activity on a daily basis.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I have been married for 15 years to Blair La Croix, a Wildlife Officer and our son Joshua La Croix is the fourth generation in Charleswood.</p>

<p>What you can expect from Nadine…</p>

<p>Find the right fiscal balance that makes real progress for Winnipeggers
• Advocate for long term financial planning
• Implement Capital Project Planning Cycles
• Balance maintenance of existing communities with new developments</p>

<p>Improve our roads, trails and transit 
• Tackle the Infrastructure Deficit
• Advocate for public transportation that makes sense
• Support active transportation initiatives</p>

<p>Modernize our water and wastewater systems; improve waste collection
• Apply innovation and advancements to system maintenance
• Set clear priorities for system upgrades
• Implement a meaningful performance measurement system for waste collection aimed at demonstrating continuous improvement </p>

<p>Fight for fairness, transparency and more results out of City Hall – results that benefit everyone
• Clear, fair and open decisions
• Implement values and ethics based decision making at all levels at City Hall
• Improve contracting and procurement processes so that they are more effective and efficient</p>
