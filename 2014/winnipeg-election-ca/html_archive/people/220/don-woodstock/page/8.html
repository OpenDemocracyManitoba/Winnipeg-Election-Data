Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>As a proud father of two children, Aspyn and Julien, born here in Winnipeg, I have a vested interest to see their future more sustainable and with less financial debt and this has motivated me for years to advocate strongly for a number of positive changes to our beautiful city.   As a multicultural community, I believe that our best strengths lie in working together and engaging meaningful dialogue with our neighbours.  Together we can build a vibrant City that has a sustainable approach to transportation, housing, child care, senior care and the youth.</p>

<p>I have been blessed to have had a grandfather, George Barrett, that spent the time to impress upon my heart the importance of taking care of, giving back and learning from our seniors during my youth.  St. Charles Ward, in my view, has one of the highest number of seniors in Winnipeg.  My way of serving would be to give back to the seniors in our community the care and attention they all deserve.  To serve them as their councillor would be my greatest honour and would certainly make my grandfather and grandmother proud.  This is why I am running in the St. Charles Ward.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>Many years successfully lobbying the Council on many issues gives me the greatest experience needed to lobby for future issues on behalf St. Charles Ward residents:
o   The name change “Garbage Day” to “Recycle Day” – it was a hard battle with Council, media and the public for 8 months, but we got it done.  It was an important First Step to beginning Recycling.
o   Reducing the number of plastic bags to the landfill.
o   Promoting Reusable bags throughout all the major malls &amp; grocery stores.
o   The larger Blue Recycling bin now found in our homes today.
o   Challenging the PPMA (Professional Property Management Association) to institute an Apartment Recycling Program.
o   Expanding the video surveillance systems in higher crime areas.</p>

<p>As a small business owner and a City of Winnipeg Transit Bus Operator, I have heard and seen many issues play-out right in front of me.  Over the years I have developed the Art of Listening to my passengers and customers which is a great asset.  </p>

<p>My dedication and commitment to ‘staying the course’, following-through and standing tall when others won’t or can’t stand makes me a more suitable candidate to advocate for St. Charles Ward residents.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>o   The Environment – making sure that we eventually ban plastic bags and implement curbside ‘compost’ pickup.
o   The Seniors – investing in affordable housing and proper monitoring of care facilities.
o   Road Construction – working with all concerned to bring out a more cost-efficient and less intrusive way of fixing our roads.  One priority is the crews work from 8:00 p.m. till 7:00 a.m. on Regional Roads not residential.
o   The Youth and childcare – My belief I have had for many years is that prevention is better than cure.  The most knowledge absorbed in our children’s lives is during 0-6 years and we need to offer the best care to them at this age.  The number One way to keep youth out of trouble is to keep them engaged in sports.</p>

<p>I believe all of these issues start and come together at the City level.  Together we can work to make our City greener, safer and more sustainable for our childrens’ children.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>During my campaign, I have had the pleasure of meeting many well-informed elderly residents who are still politically engaged who have opened their hearts and minds with a wealth of advice which I will keep in my heart forever.  In St. Charles, Crestview and Westwood many of my Meet &amp; Greets in all the blocks were very positive and welcoming.  I Thank You All for this!!  Hope to meet most of the residents before October 22nd.  Responding to a need of the seniors, I have begun a Petition to extend the Pedestrian light that crosses Portage North and South between Sturgeon and Cavalier.  As it stands today, the crossing light signals are too short and do not allow seniors enough time to cross 8 lanes of traffic.  I am confident with these changes, as small as it may be, will add a significant benefit and safety to the seniors.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>My strongest attribute is to have Vision - to lobby Council and be successful in bringing about meaningful change.  My passion and vision will bring new and exciting opportunities for the St. Charles Ward.  Some candidates have never been to City Hall to lobby for anything, or even to sit through a full day of a Council meeting to see how it works.  One prerequisite should be that “some experience at City Hall-making presentations, working with other councilors or even just advocating for an issue”</p>

<p>ASK ALL CANDIDATES:
“If you are so passionate about an issue on your information piece what have you done about it in the last 5 to 10 years?” OR
“What ideas have you presented to Council that will improve the lives of your community, the seniors, the youth and the children?”</p>

<pre><code>                                                                                     TALK IS CHEAP.  ACTION IS EVERYTHING!!
</code></pre>

<p>I am the only candidate to advocate a ‘New Way of Doing Business’.  This will come about by having weekly meetings in the community on issues that are to be voted on and for the residents to have their say.<br>
If I am blessed with your vote I am committed to you.
Please vote for Don Woodstock</p>
