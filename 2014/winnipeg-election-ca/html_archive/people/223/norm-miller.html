class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>There has become a total disconnect between the citizens, the elected leaders of the City, and the senior bureaucrats who manage the day-to-day administration of the City affairs. Many of the senior bureaucrats appear to think that the citizens are an unpleasant nuisance to the efficient management of their Departments and the elected leaders are in too cozy a relationship with the bureaucrats to have the will to &quot;crack the whip&quot; that they collectively hold in their hands, in defence of the citizens. The water main problems (on I believe it was Laxdale Blvd.) where there were at least 10 breaks in 8 weeks last winter and the residents were told that replacement of the mains was scheduled only for the summer of 2015 and that nothing could be done before that date is one example - and then Charles Adler got involved and the scheduling was moved up to 2014. Another example of the senior bureaucracy run amok  is where a citizen in my ward ran afoul of a junior bureaucrat in the Neighbourhood Liveability Dept. over his determination that certain items on the citizen&#39;s property were &quot;garbage&quot; and had to be immediately removed.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>The citizen appealed the bureaucrat&#39;s Order to the appropriate Council sub-committee (after paying a $250 appeal fee) but was unable to appear on the appeal date because he was ill. The citizen notified the City Clerk of the illness before the scheduled meeting requesting an adjournment, however, the agents for the head of the Dept.,Clive Wightman, forced the Chairman, Scott Fielding, to hold the hearing in the absence of the citizen and a decision against the citizen was registered. In due course the City bureaucracy attended at the citizen&#39;s property , removed what they considered &quot;garbage&quot; in a 1 hour operation and added a total of $840.00 to the citizen&#39;s property tax bill to &quot;cover the cost&quot; of the 1 hour &quot;garbage&quot; removal. These stories are legion. They are happening all over the City. Is it any wonder that every young family that is able to move to one of the many &quot;bedroom communities&quot; surrounding Winnipeg has done so, is in the process of doing so or is waiting for the outcome of this election before they decide to do so? I am a retired financial professional ( accountant) and I can clearly see where Winnipeg is headed.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>And it is not a pretty place. Everyone had better get ready  for at least a 25% property tax increase over the next 4 years, because the &quot;day of reckoning&quot; is right around the corner. I am not standing for issues so much as trying to warn my fellow citizens about issues that are not being discussed during this election. I am a finance guy, not a trained nurse or musician (God bless them both). I have seen many businesses fail because of poor management, inattention to customer needs, employee hostility/vindictiveness and I see it again in the City of Winnipeg. The City of Winnipeg is on the verge of a very nasty war with its &quot;bedroom communities&quot; over the &quot;poaching&quot; by those communities of its long term tax base ie: financially stable young families in search of safe, clean and friendly communities where they can put down roots and raise their children - with much lower property taxes than are assessed in Winnipeg for the same type of property. The buzz word is &quot;transparency&quot;. I am a finance guy and I don&#39;t have a clue as to the long term state of the City&#39;s finances. Do you?</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>For instance, what is the &quot;unfunded pension liability&quot; that the City is going to have to pay out to its retired employees over the next 20 years and how is this debt going to be retired while at the same time that major infrastructure (another buzz word) renewal ABSOLUTELY HAS TO BE DONE. This Ward has to be one of the most unique on the continent. It runs from Waterfront Drive in The Forks  to North/South Drive in Fort Garry, to the &quot;Gates&quot; of Armstrong Point, Maryland St. to Portage Ave. to the Red River and down to the St. Vital bridge, along Churchill Drive to Jubilee Ave. to Pembina Hwy. The Ward includes both #1 Wellington Crescent and considerably lesser residences on Langside St. It has Osborne Village (one of the best residential areas in Canada), night people, day people, straight people, gay people, black people, white people, asian people, aboriginal and metis people, former Russian, American, Chinese, European, Indian, Pakistani, German and Jewish people, very rich people and &quot;bag ladies&quot; all living together in (relative) peace. A true touch stone for the Museum Of Human Rights.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am a father, a retired accountant, a former Official Agent for a Federal Green Party candidate, a former member of the Federal Green Party, someone who grew up in a nice, loving, middle class family with the associated toys. I have been a long term resident of &quot;The Village&quot; and it has softened many of my rough and radical edges. But when the accountants start getting angry WATCH OUT.</p>
