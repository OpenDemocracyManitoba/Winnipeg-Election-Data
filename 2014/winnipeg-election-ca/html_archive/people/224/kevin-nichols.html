Nichols</h2><p>Candidate in the <a href="/electoral_races/44/council-ward-charleswood-tuxedo-2014">2014 Charleswood - Tuxedo Council Ward race</a>.</p><p>There are <a href="#recent_news">40 recent

list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I decided to run for City Council mainly because I have been disappointed in the way the City has been run.  For far too long I have seen inaction, roadblocks and excuses as to why action can not be done to improve the City.  I have seen a lot of finger pointing in all directions except the direction that it should be, and that is at City Council.  I have decided it is time to step up, take action and run for council.  Change needs to happen and I hope to bring that change in, that is why I decided to run.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>Having worked for the City for over 28 years, I can say my experience is vast.  Working in Departments such as Winnipeg Transit and now Public Works, I can say I do have great knowledge and appreciation for the workings within the City.  I have experienced first hand the front line issues the City is faced with and the need to fix a system that is broken.  Working as a mechanic at Transit, I have dealt with the public on many different fronts.  I have experienced the troubles plaguing the system that prevents people from moving on our buses in an efficient manner.
As a Safety Technician for Public Works, I deal with all levels of employees from the worker fixing your potholes, to managers ensuring service gets to the people that need it the most.  I deal with policy, by-laws and guidelines that help ensure the citizens of Winnipeg are safe during our construction season.<br>
As for education, I have been educated at University of Manitoba in Maths and Sciences, I have 2 Certifications from Red River College and a vast array of training provided by various organizations including the City of Winnipeg and Province of Manitoba.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Transparency is a big one, information should be readily available to all citizens who ask.  Contracts should not be secret.  The citizens shouldnt know how much a contractor pays its employees but the citizens should have the right to know how much the contract is costing the City.
The citizens should also know how councillors vote on an issue, that should be made public.</p>

<p>Accountability is another issue that is lacking and I would like to bring that back.  We need to stand up for what we did, good or bad, and be held accountable for our actions.</p>

<p>These issues are big ones for me.  For far too long City Council has been pointing fingers, finding scape goats and performing a smoke and mirror show.  We need to fix our own problems and not rely on the Province, or blame the Province or blame anyone else for that matter.  It is soley because of the lack of accountability that we are in the mess we are in.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I appreciate the people.  We have a large diverse population in the Charleswood Tuxedo Whyte Ridge ward and they are all equally wonderful.  I have volunteered with many groups, school councils, football clubs, and environmental groups.  I have always enjoyed the people that have stepped up to help, always appreciated the willingness to help when help is needed.  I am sure that my area is not unique to this but it is something I have grown to appreciate.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Throughout this campaign I have always failed to state the obvious.  I dont want to bore people with &quot;fix the roads&quot;.<br>
I encourage people to ask questions, think for themselves and challenge all those running for council.  Think outside the box and dont just settle for the same old thing we have.  The same old thing isnt working anymore.
I am a hands on person and if I am elected I will ensure to remain hands on where it is needed.</p>
