Chartrand.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a href="/pages/13/frequently-asked-questions#candidate_info">how we decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I believe that Point Douglas’s defining issue – the issue that will determine how well the ward does in the future – is ensuring that all residents of Point Douglas have access to the labour market and the services that much of Winnipeg takes for granted. I will work to create more jobs and opportunities in Point Douglas, fix our roads, and make our communities safer.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I have led provincial and division-wide policy changes that lead the way for expanded Aboriginal education. I led key developments for the ACE Aboriginal Circle of Educators from 2005- 2009. I founded CAEM -Council for Aboriginal Education in Manitoba, which affiliated with the Manitoba Teachers Society as a Special Area Group of Educators-SAGE. I also founded of the Manitoba Aboriginal Education Awards banquet and was instrumental in getting two annual Aboriginal education conferences off the ground in Manitoba.</p>

<p>Through my work I have been listening to a wide range of viewpoints, and it is clear that city council must focus on the priorities of the individuals and families in the ward. That is why I will focus on making our communities safer, fixing our roads, and creating more jobs and opportunities. I will stand up for these priorities and for the people of Point Douglas at city hall.</p>

<p>I am a seasoned bridge builder who also knows how to get things done. I will work to illuminate people’s strengths raising people up to assume roles and responsibilities as leaders. I use my past experience to get results for the people of Point Douglas.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I have been raising awareness of Missing and Murdered Indigenous women for over 20 years through the education of others, which started with co-writing and performing in the play “Those Damn Squaws” with Winnipeg&#39;s Red Roots Theatre. My interest in bringing this subject to light came from having one of my own friends go missing 20 years ago. More recently I helped initiate Drag the Red, which has gathered volunteers to actively search for missing peoples in Winnipeg&#39;s Red River.  </p>

<p>As well, I am focused on key priorities for the ward: Safer communities, more jobs and opportunities, and fixing our roads.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Point Douglas is a very diverse ward, both culturally and economically. This diversity is a key strength of the ward, and I would be honoured to represent that diversity and ensure all voices are represented at city hall.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I see this election as a tremendous opportunity to bring new people into the democratic process. I have been inspired by the enthusiasm and hope of the people of Point Douglas, and I would be honoured to represent this ward on city council.</p>
