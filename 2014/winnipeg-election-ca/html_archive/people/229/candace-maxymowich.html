candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I wouldn’t be running for School Trustee if I didn’t care deeply about the future of students in Louis Riel School Division. I care about making sure students have access to a variety of programs. I care about making sure parents know what’s going on in our schools and with their children. I care about making sure teachers have the resources, tools, and support they need to do their jobs and to do their jobs well.</p>

<p>I value our community and am motivated to engage our community in supporting the education of our students. I don’t have all of the answers to the challenges our schools and our school board face, but I believe that together we can find solutions because the future of our students is worth every effort. I believe that every student deserves the best we have to offer. Each child is precious and valuable and is worthy of our finest efforts. </p>

<p>I would be so honoured to have the opportunity to serve as school trustee and join in the important discussions on defining and achieving success for students in Louis Riel School Division.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I reside in Royalwood and am active in the community. I’m currently a board meber of the Norberry-Glenlee Community Centre. I’ve always been passionate about working for the benefit of others and currently work at West Broadway Community Ministry – an organization that offers many services to people living in poverty. I’ve also worked as a Research Assistant to a City Councillor. </p>

<p>My volunteerism and commitment to the community have effected change both in organizational policy and community engagement. I have served as Co-Chair of the Youth Advisory Council to the Province of Manitoba and as a facilitator at the North End Youth Forum. I have developed strong relationships with many influential leaders through my dedication to many organizations in Winnipeg, throughout the province, and across Canada. I have received awards for my contributions including the Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, Manitoba Council on Aging Recognition Award, Lieutenant Governor’s Make a Difference Community Award, the Fred Douglas Foundation Humanitarian Award, and was a YWCA Young Woman of Distinction Award nominee. </p>

<p>My energy and passion for bettering the lives of others and close ties to the community will allow me to provide strong representation as a School Trustee.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>The safety of all students and staff is paramount to me. I support efforts to expand the School Resource Officer program and will advocate for increased safety in our schools. SROs work to build stronger relationships with youth and the community. Having a visible presence in our schools is a pro-active approach to reduce violence, bullying, drugs and other criminal activities. The role of the SRO is to provide support to students, parents, and school staff by answering calls for service regarding incidents occurring in schools. </p>

<p>Children who experience poverty are less likely to be ready for school, do well in school, and stay in school. I’m passionate about ensuring students and their families receive the necessary supports to allow children to reach their full potential. We can work towards supporting students by providing early intervention to help low-achieving students improve their reading and writing skills which are the necessary foundation for effective learning in all other subjects. Mentoring focused on academics is also an effective practice when addressing specific needs such as reading, writing, or math competencies. Teachers need to feel supported and have an avenue by which they can continue to develop skills. </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>We live in a diverse community. An important part of being a school trustee is staying in touch with community stakeholders. With more than 14,000 students and their families, as well as the larger community, it can be a challenge to communicate broadly and utilize communication resources wisely. I believe it&#39;s paramount that parents, teachers, and the community at large be informed and involved in school board decisions and activities. Actively seeking the expertise, perspectives, and ideas of those affected by decisions made by our school board makes people feel involved and valued. I believe it is important to take everyone’s view into consideration. </p>

<p>Louis Riel School Division has been recognized for its work in addressing the social and emotional needs of students. I will serve as a strong advocate for increased awareness of mental health and wellness for students and educators. I am particularly interested in at risk youth and have a special interest in the mental health of children. Schools play a critical role in nurturing the development of children’s self-confidence, problem solving skills and other factors that contribute to mental health. I also believe that it’s important that educators have access to appropriate supports.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve faced a lot of criticism throughout this campaign.</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt said “it’s not the critic who counts. Not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the person who is in the arena. Who’s faces is marred with dust and sweat and blood. Who strives valiantly. Who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly.” </p>

<p>I’ve come to learn that the more you put yourself out there and take a stand for something you believe in, the more people come out of the woodwork and try to tear you down. You have to get used to it and shake it off if you want to come off the sidelines and be in the arena. </p>

<p>I’ve also come to learn that you need to have a complete clarity of values, to not waiver from those values, and to know what your own value is. I value courage. I value accountability, honesty, and compassion. More than anything, I believe that every child is valuable.</p>
