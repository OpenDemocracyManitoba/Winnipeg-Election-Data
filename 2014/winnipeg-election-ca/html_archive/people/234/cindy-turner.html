Election?</h3>

<p>When I was first approached by leaders in our community to run for school trustee, I honestly didn’t think it was for me.  However, after talking with my family and neighbours, they encouraged me to put my name on the ballot.  They reminded me of all of the time I spend volunteering with children through my church and when my children were still in school, at their school library, as well as the week-long Harry Potter day camps I still put on in my own back yard every summer.  I have always had an interest in children’s education, and have wanted them to live up to their potential.  Running for school trustee is a better fit than I had originally thought. I come with no personal agenda except to move the LRSD forward to be an excellent school district.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>In 2001 I started working for United Way of Winnipeg in the finance department.  I understand the big picture, which is the need to do more with less and the need for good fiscal judgment. I also have significant governing board experience having been on the Unifor, formerly CEP, Local 191 executive board since 2010 and have been the Secretary Treasurer since 2012.  </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I believe in the equal and fair treatment of all students. That being said I also believe that children are individuals and do not learn at the same level or pace.  Some children are visual learners while some are tactile learners. It is because of this, or rather the lack of identifying this that causes some children to fall through the cracks.  It is our duty and those of the professionals to identify those children who are at risk and find a better way to educate them.  Children have a right to an education and it is our job to see they get it.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Wow, this is a difficult question.  I am finding it very hard to narrow it down to one particular thing.  If I have to choose only one, I would have to say it is the rich cultural heritage of Ward 1.  </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Whether it is overcrowded classrooms or under funded programs, there is a way to unravel the problems, however, there needs to be a voice in place that will look out for the interests of our children and educators. Our children have a right to a good education and it is our duty to ensure they get one. For these reasons I feel I must step forward to offer the voters a choice.</p>
