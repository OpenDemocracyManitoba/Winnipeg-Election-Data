class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>As a parent, I have bore witness to the importance of public education, and feel--despite the LRSD&#39;s numerous successes--there is still much to be improved upon. Over the next few years, the LRSD will face a number of challenges (population growth, financing, accommodating the K-3 initiative, etc), and I want to assist the Division in effectively addressing these challenges while ensuring our children receive quality educations.  </p>

<p>Over the past year, community members have expressed dissatisfaction with the Division&#39;s communication and consultation efforts, specifically through two critical transitions (Ecole Marie-Anne-Gaboury/Hastings School; Ecole Julie Riel/Ecole St. Germaine/George McDowell School). Once &quot;the dust settled,&quot; I came to realize  much more could have been done proactively to ease the fear, anger, and angst in the community.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>On a day to day basis, I work with diverse groups on local, national, and international levels. I have a proven track record of encouraging public engagement, and have successfully implemented a number of programs in Winnipeg&#39;s publishing community. I am an engaged community volunteer, having served on the parent committee at my daughter&#39;s school for the past eight years (the past two as president), on the board of my daughter&#39;s preschool, as well as being a community coordinator and canvasser for the Heart and Stroke Foundation. </p>

<p>A communications professional, I have extensive experience in developing effective communication materials, in a number of mediums. Communication is a two-way street, and I am an effective listener who consults and researches prior to making to crucial decisions.</p>

<p>As an arts administrator, I have a great deal of proficiency in lobbying, and in developing and managing budgets. Having served on a number of boards and committees in Winnipeg&#39;s arts and publishing communities through the years, I have extensive knowledge about governance and administration.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>One of the single-best ways to build nurturing school communities is through parent involvement. I want the Division to be proactive in broadening parent councils, while expanding upon its initiatives to engage community members in the governance process. I will expect each of my colleagues to be visible in our schools, be it at parent committee meetings or events, while actively engaging with community members. </p>

<p>Despite the the K-3 initiative, the provincial government did not increase its funding to LRSD. I believe it&#39;s important to lobby for funding increases, as property taxes should not be the emphasis when funding public education.</p>

<p>There are changing demographics in the Division (increased enrollment in some schools, decreased enrollment in others; housing developments; immigration). Is the LRSD meeting the needs of each and every student? Ongoing assessment is needed, and should be prioritized.</p>

<p>No student should feel marginalized because of ability, gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion. I believe in inclusive education, and feel programming for the Division’s Indigenous and recently immigrated students is crucial. I believe every school should be safe, and will encourage administrators and staff to participate in LGBTTQ and cultural sensitivity training and education programs. </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I am grateful the LRSD is progressive, forward thinking, and at the forefront  with regards to French Immersion education. I appreciate the diversity of our community, schools, students and educators.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am looking forward to building upon relationships to effectively serve our schools, educators, community, parents, and most importantly, our students. More information about my candidacy/platform is available at www.carlenerummery.ca and on my facebook page: facebook.com/carlene.rummery</p>
