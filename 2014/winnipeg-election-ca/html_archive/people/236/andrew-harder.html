<p>I am running for School Trustee to ensure that the Pembina Trails School Division is all that it can be.  I have two young sons who will be entering the Division very shortly and I am a concerned parent who wants to ensure that the already high standards of Pembina Trails are maintained and built upon.  I am a teacher and I can relate to the successes and struggles that a teacher may have in their day to day role as educator and mentor to our young students.  I know first hand how a school operates.  The dynamic between administrators and staff is unique and is best dealt with by someone who understands it and has experience with it.  My strong background in Economics will be a big asset in providing sound fiscal management and ensuring that taxpayer money is spent efficiently and effectively.  </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I have sat on Boards and committees and know how they work and function and conversely how they can be stalled.  I am a strong leader and effective communicator.  I am a teacher and coach and am extremely competent in problem solving.  I am and have been in charge of large budgets and know how to manage these budgets without any deficit.  I have Bachelor Degrees in both Economics and Education which I feel are a great combination for the role of School Trustee.  I will bring strong financial guidance and knowledge to the Office of Trustee and also bring the compassion and communication skills as an effective teacher.  </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I would like to ensure that our children are eating healthier and more nutritious food in our schools.  It has been proven time and again that a proper diet coupled with proper amounts of exercise is extremely beneficial to a child&#39;s overall well being and academic success.  It is important for me to ensure our tax dollars are being spent effectively and efficiently.  Do our teachers have the necessary tools for success?  Do they have proper access to ongoing Professional Development?  Do parents have a proper voice?  Do parents have the access they need to be heard?  I stand for all of these issues and will ensure that the answer is yes to all of these questions.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I appreciate the genuine care and concern the residents of Pembina Trails have for their children and for their children&#39;s success.  This is a very involved community which is great.  Our residents need the very best people on the Board to ensure that their children&#39;s needs and concerns are treated with respect and the utmost concern.  A Trustee needs to be accountable and accessible and I will provide both.  Everyone wants what is best for their child.  I will do everything that I can to ensure this is the case.  </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I bring unique traits to the Office of School Trustee.  I am a current teacher with a strong background in Economics and Finance.  I am relevant.  I have two young sons who will be entering the Division shortly. As such, I have a vested interest in the success of the Division, the administrators, teachers, support staff etc.  If elected, I will stand with the parents and students ensuring that their voices are head, I will provide strong financial leadership and that our tax dollars are not wasted.  I will be a natural ally for the teachers ensuring that they have the necessary tools for success in the classroom.  Manitoba&#39;s education system ranks last in Canada.  It is time for change. On Oct. 22 please vote for Andrew Harder as School Trustee and lets get to work.  Thanks.</p>
