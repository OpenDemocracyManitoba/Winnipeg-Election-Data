<p>I made a decision to run for a school trustee 2 years ago when I was retiring from 32 years as a teacher and school principal in Frontier and River East Transcona School divisions. I grew up in Transcona, my wife and I, as well as our children all attended Transcona schools and I still live in the community. I value the quality of education in our division and want to be part of enhancing it so our children, grandchildren and their children all have opportunities for success today and tomorrow. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>My 32 years of experience as an educator and school administrator provide me with a perspective of the classroom as well as school and divisional operations. I believe I can bring an educational perspective and voice to the board of trustees. I have also served on various boards in different roles for community clubs and currently as President of the Transcona Major Jr Hockey Club all in the spirit of making our community a better place and providing our youth with positive lifestyle options. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>In reality there are two key areas that I want to focus on and have focused on throughout my career, that of fostering a positive learning environment for students to all be successful as well as ensuring their safety and well being. All issues that a school and school board deal with should revolve around these both today and for tomorrow. Academic success looks different for all students but should be driven from school data and purposefully planned for improvement while being fiscally responsible to the constituents of Transcona. 
To identify one or two specific issues at this time would not be practical without collecting data and feedback from all stakeholders in the system. I welcome the opportunities to work with various stakeholders and decision makers. I believe in collaboration, open dialogue and ensuring everyone has input or voice so they feel part of the process which builds trusting relationships. </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Transcona is a special community and I am proud to be part of it, in the same way as I am proud to have been a part of a very progressive educational system. RETSD offers quality programming throughout the levels from early numeracy and literacy programs in EY to IB in SY. RETSD is also responsive to the learning trends in education as well as the needs of the community, as illustrated through the exceptional EAL programming offered for so many new Canadians entering our system.
- While RETSD is able to provide diverse, differentiated and specialized learning it still maintains one of the lowest per student costs in the province.
-   Teaching and support staff are being presented with more and more diverse classrooms hosting a wide range of abilities, and require resources and strategies to support these needs.
-   Early intervention is crucial. . 
-   Since schools and school sites were not designed to handle this level of traffic flow we now have enormous safety issues around most of our EY schools. This needs to be reviewed with parents, staff  and community members to look at alternatives for getting children to school and home safely.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I have always seen myself as a supporter of learning, as a teacher, a coach and school principal. The most important people in education are those working directly with children as they have the most direct influence on students. I hope to continue to supporting education from a different perspective but also helping to prioritize educational needs for today and tomorrow while taking responsibility for costs of this education
As a committed trustee I will;
 -work collaboratively with others<br>
 -listen carefully to the needs of those within the system and the community 
 -use what I hear to make informed decisions for the division as a whole 
  -communicate those decisions back to all stakeholders
  -be available and responsive to questions/concerns from the community
 - model on-going learning </p>
