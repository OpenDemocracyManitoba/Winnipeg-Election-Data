class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I want to continue to make a positive impact on the education offered in Pembina Trails.  I have represented Ward 3 of Pembina Trails School Division for the past 16 years.  When I ran initially, I was the parent to an elementary and a high school student and was deeply interested in the decisions made by the Division and how they had an effect on the education of my children.  I have continued to be passionate about providing the best possible education for children in Pembina Trails.  My children have now graduated from Pembina Trails Schools, and have gone on to further education.  My son is a graduate of the University of Manitoba in computer science and law, and my daughter is currently attending university in the US.  Prior to University she completed her apprenticeship and worked as a hairstylist.  As a parent of children who have been all the way through Pembina Trails Schools, in both the French Immersion and English program, and are successfully commencing their careers, my knowledge of their challenges, successes and experiences provides essential background into the decisions I make as a Trustee.   </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I am the Executive Director of a regulated health profession in Manitoba.  My career began in law, where I was a paralegal for many years, working both in law firms and for private industry.  I have been a Trustee for 16 years; Chair (2005-2007) of the Board of Trustees and Vice-Chair (2003-2005) of the Board of Trustees.  I have served on all of the Committees of the Board, and have chaired the Finance Committee (2000-2003), and Communications Committee (2012-2014).  I was a member of the Governing Board of Winnipeg Technical College (now Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology) from 2006-2010, and Chair of that Governing Board from 2008-2010.  I believe that School Boards benefit from a variety of perspectives, which is best achieved by having Trustees that range from parents at home with young children through to experienced executives with a variety of business experience.  </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>As a Trustee, I&#39;ve always asked about the data we have to determine whether our children are engaged in their education and achieving their goals.  This is an important way to ensure that our work bears fruit for our Division and our children.  I have supported our three divisional goals:  that all children be engaged in their education, that by Grade 8 all students should be achieving at grade level, and that all children graduate.  These goals form an important foundation in how all Pembina Trails School Division employees work with the children in their care.  I hope to continue to work on these and other issues that are important for our future.  </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve lived in the Pembina Trails School Division for most of my life.  My husband and I, and our siblings, are all graduates of the Pembina Trails School Division.  My children are graduates of Vincent Massey and Fort Richmond Collegiates.  I believe that the education offered to students in Pembina Trails is excellent and that the people who work with and for the Division are ethical, caring and committed educators.  I hope to be able to help ensure this will continue.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I hope to have the opportunity to continue to represent the voters of Pembina Trails School Division Ward 3 for another four years.  </p>
