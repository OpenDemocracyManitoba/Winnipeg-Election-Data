Election?</h3>

<p>I have a deep and abiding passion for this city, its people, and its institutions. I have been raised to believe that public service is the highest calling, and that working to improve our community and society is an obligation for all those who are able. My father met his obligation to serve by flying a C130 Hercules in the Canadian Air Force. After obtaining my Bachelor of Arts in Political Studies, I worked in the private sector to gain valuable experience. Now that I have established myself, and learned many valuable life lessons, I&#39;m ready to fulfill my obligation by working to improve St. Boniface specifically, and the City of Winnipeg as a whole.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>My background in the private sector will be a valuable asset to my work as city councillor. As a result of my experience in sales and marketing, I have formed strong relationships in the business community in this city, especially small business owners. Through these relationships, I have been able to gain insight into the challenges that small business owners face on a daily basis. I will seek to address those issues, in particular, streamlining the permit and licensing processes wherever possible.</p>

<p>In addition, my marketing background will help me to promote the city, and especially St. Boniface, in order to attract businesses, tourists, and families looking for a vibrant, energized place to settle down. I will also work to more fully integrate the St. Boniface business community, especially around the Provencher Bridge and l&#39;Esplanade Riel into the burgeoning new developments downtown and in the Exchange District.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>We know that the incoming City Council will look vastly different from the outgoing one. This will provide an excellent and rare opportunity to re-shape our civic governance. The past decade has seen City Hall plagued by scandal and impropriety.</p>

<p>I will work with the new Council to re-claim City Hall as a chamber of and for the people of Winnipeg. In order to regain the trust of the people, we need to re-establish a sense of transparency and accountability for our elected representatives and civic officials. My focus will be on establishing records of all debates and votes in Council, and making them publicly available online and in hard copy, as well as entirely searchable.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The thing I appreciate most about the ward is its diversity. It goes without saying that the history and rich francophone heritage make St. Boniface exciting and vital, and a community unique in Canada, if not the world. However, the ward extends beyond old St. Boniface and includes such distinct areas as Windsor Park, Island Lakes, Royalwood, and Sage Creek. Each area has its own distinct character, as well as its own unique set of economic, cultural and infrastructure priorities. Representing all of the people of the ward is a unique challenge, and I hope I have the opportunity to meet that challenge.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am the best candidate for the people of St. Boniface because I am running to represent them, not any special interest group, and not any political party machine. I have a vision for the ward, and the city. Ideas matter. Policy matters. This is not a vanity campaign, but a campaign based on structured, thought-out ideas and how to make them work best for the people of St. Boniface. Artful rhetoric alone isn&#39;t enough to improve the quality of our lives. Neither is vision without being grounded in reason. I believe strongly in vision with reason, not rhetoric. My ideas are grounded in reality. They are pragmatic, possible, and not based on partisan dogma. My vision can be achieved, and if the people of St. Boniface elect me, I will work tirelessly to achieve it.</p>
