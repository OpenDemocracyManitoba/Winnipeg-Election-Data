we decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I could not believe the nonsense and lack of common sense decisions made by the past council &amp; mayor.  Things such as $40,000 raise in their ward allowance, wanting to give certain condo purchasers $10,000, wasting $150,000 to rent falcons to harass seagulls at the Brady Landfill,  wanting to spend $30 million on one dog park and giving the outgoing mayor and councillors a severance package.  These things are absolutely unwarranted and ridiculous and show a complete lack of respect for the taxpayers of this city.  In the scheme of things, these may be small but they all add up and this money could have been put to better use.  We deserve much better than what we are getting!</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>As a teacher for 30 years, I have worked with over 5 thousand students as well as fellow teachers, administrators and parents.  In many ways, councillors and the mayor show a lack of direction and wisdom needed to run the city properly. I am confident that my teaching experience would help in this regard.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>It seems that the past administration is determined to keep Winnipeg in the past.  Our infrastructure is in no better shape then it was 50 years ago.  Look at the &quot;Disraeli Freeway&quot; as an example--why is there a traffic light on this freeway as soon as you turn off Main St. to go to East Kildonan?  Why are both spans 2 lanes wide when they should have been 3 lanes  to accommodate present traffic, never mind future needs such as possibly rapid transit?  </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Although  St. Boniface is basically the French Quarter of Winnipeg, it is great to see that there is also a large variety of ethnicities not only in the population but also in businesses.  This not only makes this ward interesting but strong.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I have already been contacted by numerous residents with important concerns regarding themselves or the community at large.  If elected, you can bet that I will not be turning my back on these people and will do my upmost to resolve these situations regardless what part of the ward they reside in.</p>
