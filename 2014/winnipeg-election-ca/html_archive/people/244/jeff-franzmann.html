Election?</h3>

<p>I have two children attending school in the division, and going through the educational process with them has given me a new appreciation for both what has worked well and what could be improved on in terms of how curriculum is delivered, and how we can better prepare our children for the world they will enter. I might have stayed on the sidelines were it not for comments from some trustees about how the position is a &#39;stepping stone&#39; to some greater political office, or how some would like to impose their personal beliefs on the broad spectrum of diversity that attends public school in the division. Those comments reminded me of the importance of taking part in the political process not just as a voter, but if necessary as an active candidate as well. We all want our children to enter the world prepared, confident, and equipped to deal with what they will face, it is the common purpose of all parents.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>As a parent with two children going through the division right now, I have a certain level of personal experience in dealing with the administration, especially in terms of how the Division approaches the provision of services to special needs children. That being said, I believe the role of trustee is as the voice and advocate for the community, and as someone who has worked in customer facing management roles with two of Canada&#39;s largest corporations, I have a wealth of experience when it comes to advocacy, dealing with difficult circumstances, and insuring that solutions to complex situations are approached with the interests of all sides in mind. I also have over a decade of educational background in Cultural Anthropology, which has taught me that while our schools and communities are local, solutions to some of the challenges we face today can be found in a variety of cultures and across the globe.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I believe that the role of technology in the classroom needs to be given a more prominent role than it has. Our children will be going out into a world where even the most basic, entry level jobs and community roles require a basic degree of technical aptitude. I believe technology can be used to provide more transparency in the decision making process, and will be advocating for the full record of all school board meetings to be archived and maintained for public access, except in so far as material is legally sensitive (for security and HR reasons). We are elected as Trustees not because we are in some way more knowledgeable than the public we represent, and the public has a right to know how we are representing them. </p>

<p>I also believe we need to take a firm stand against the promotion of any religion within the public schools. Religious education is the role of the parent or religious leader, not the school. Public Schools are to prepare children of multiple backgrounds, faiths and cultures for a bright future within Canada, not to recruit new members of a particular faith.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The Louis Riel School Division is incredibly diverse and filled with young families who want the best for their children. I want to bring forward the best those families have to offer the community, celebrate the diversity they represent, and make sure that their concerns are addressed quickly, with compassion, and to build a better future for the School Division.</p>
