class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I have been involved with my children&#39;s schools in Pembina Trails School Division for over 13 years in various capacities from volunteer, Chair of Parent Council, Chair of Lunch Program and Safe Grad just to name a few. I have also been involved many Pembina Trails School Division issues such as transportation, safety during lunch, new high school initiatives and healhy foods, working with Pembina Trails School Board and Trustees so this exposure was invaluable in my confidence in my ability to run and fulfill the responsibilities of a School Trustee in Pembina Trails School Divison - Ward 2. I am also very active and committed to the betterment of my community and our schools, and for these reasons I believe I can represent the parents and community members within the Division.  </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>My experience includes both the volunteer roles I have played within the Pembina School Division over the past 13 years. I am also bilingual and my children attend both the English and French Immersion Programs in the Division. I have a Bachelor&#39;s Degree at the University of Manitoba and have been a Human Resources professional for over 20 years.  As a Human Resources Manager, I work with high school and post secondary students for work placements, apprenticeship programs, part-time, summer and full-time career opportunities. I believe strongly that by providing young people opportunities to put their education and skills into the workplace is a valuable component as part of their ongoing education and attainment of skills for their future. The role of the School Trustee includes school policies, programs and also strategic planning for long term vision, fiscal management and employee relations. As a part of my management responsibilities, I am involved in strategic planning, sound fiscal management and fostering strong employee relations. I believe my experience and background provide me a solid background of the issues and priorities of Pembina Trails School Division and the business acumen to incorporate those into policies and programs, representing families and taxpayers alike. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Some of the issues I would like to stand for as a School Trustee are to:
• Leverage our investments in existing Technology resources to maximize the learning opportunities for all student
• Focus on effective use of tax dollars with the goal to hold the line on school property taxes
• Communicate with parents, and parent councils to understand the challenges and priorities of each school
• Improve school resources, facilities and classroom settings to ensure students of all needs, backgrounds and abilities can learn in a safe and stimulating environment. 
These issues are important to me as we need to ensure young people are engaged in their learning through the resources they and our educators have access to, including  technology, and that as a School Trustee I leverage these resources and investments with measurable benefits and that we are fiscally responsible to maximize our funds as we are accountable to our taxpayers. As a parent, I appreciate the opportunities to learn, participate and collaborate in school and divisional initiatives and parents have an integral role to play. As a School Trustee my role will be to ensure I listen, share and be available to families I represent. </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The one thing I can appreciate about the school division I wish to represent is the diversity of challenges faced by young people, families, educators, Board staff and the School Trustees in Pembina Trails School Division. There are so many factors to consider in setting priorities, programs, and budgets, listing just a few such as the spectrum of student needs, the availabiltiy of creative and engaging resources and technology within the classroom for students and educators, the cost of resources, and the desire and the expectations to offer young people a variety of choices so their education will prepare them for ongoing educational pursuits and/or the workforce. The balancing of all these challenges and desire to enure Pembina Trails School Division provides stimulating environment for all students to learn is an aspect I appreciate about the Division I wish to represent. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I would be honored to represent the families and taxpayers within Pembina Trails School Division - Ward 2 and believe my past experience and current involvement in our schools within Pembina Trails Division, my background and skills I can effectively represent the working families and taxpayers in our community and Pembina Trails School Division-Ward 2. I welcome the opportunity to speak with community members and can be reached various ways listed on the candidate profile on City of Winnipeg Election website.  </p>
