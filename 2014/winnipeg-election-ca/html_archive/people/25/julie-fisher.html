class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I was first elected in 2010, I am seeking re-election because I feel I would bring continuity and experience to the board of trustees.  Our ward has experienced a lot of change in the last four years, I would like to use what I have learned and apply it to the next four years.  The role of school trustee is a very fulfilling job.  Pembina Trails is made up extremely talented and loving people that share one common goal, to provide quality education to our children and support them as they develop into confident, caring adults.  I am inspired by our schools every day and I want to continue to be part of a team that supports our children and the community they live in. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I have gained valuable experience in the last four years as a trustee in ward 3.  I am chair of the Building, Property and Transportation committee and past chair of the Pembina Trails Educational Support Fund.  I have been a member of the Education committee, the Communications committee and the Finance committee.  I am a current governing board member for Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology (formerly Winnipeg Technical College).  I am a provincial trustee representative for a Manitoba School Boards Association committee.  I completed an intensive coaching program which I received a certificate in the iPEC educational leadership program - coach centric leadership for education professionals.  I am very involved in the community and I volunteer in various roles: President of Richmond Kings Nursery School, Treasurer to Sparks unit 351st, Preteen Dance Coordinator at Richmond Kings Community Centre, a member of the Fort Garry Community Network, a member of the Fort Garry Healthy Together Now Grant selection committee and a volunteer at the Mid-Winter Festival at Acadia Jr. High and will be committee chair in 2015.  </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>The school division needs to have a strong voice in the community.  I consistently advocate for community consultation and follow up regarding any changes to current and future programming.
The Province of Manitoba has mandated a cap of 20 children per classroom from Kindergarten to grade 3.  I feel it is important to maintain lower numbers of children in grade 4 classrooms as well because they are still early years learners.
Our division is planning to build 5 new schools over the next 15-20 years.  I support long term financial planning for the division to balance the costs of maintaining its current programming with the addition of new schools.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>In 2010 the Board of Trustees implemented their three expectations for student learning: All students will be engaged in their learning, all students will be meeting provincial curricular standards in literacy and numeracy and all students will graduate.  These have served as a north star for schools to set goals and collect data to track progress.  The division&#39;s 21st century learning belief statement also supports these expectations.  I want to continue the work that has been done on developing the three expectations.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>It has been an honour to represent my community as a trustee in Pembina Trails; I truly love my job and the people I work with.  Please visit my website JulieFisher.ca for more information.  </p>
