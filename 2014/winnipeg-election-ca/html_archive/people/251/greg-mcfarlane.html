class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>My passion has always been focused towards the new generation.  My experience as a recruiter and advocate for young people entering the workforce has drawn my attention to the growing need for workforce preparedness skills.  I believe we can do better.  As a new father, I want to ensure that my child and his peers are better prepared by our school system.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I have worked with a variety of organizations, committees and youth agencies during my time as a labour leader.   I view myself as an advocate for young workers in Manitoba.  I have prepared and chaired meetings, and have experience in Parliamentary procedure.  I have a strong work ethic and pay close attention to detail.  I have gained valuable budgeting skills while making major decisions on the allocation of resources.  I am able to think outside the box while contributing to a collaborative team environment.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>My overall focus as a School Trustee will be to increase the resources available to our students.  This includes improvement to recreational facilities and green spaces, after-hours access to school gymnasiums and increased child care programs.  My vision includes a reallocation of funding for enrichment programs, math, science and arts education as well as an increase in support staff within the schools to ensure maximum benefit for our students.  This is important to me because investing in our students basic needs for education and recreation will directly benefit them as they grow into active citizenship within our community.  </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Seven Oaks excels at welcoming the diversity of our students and our community.  I believe that the programs we currently have in place are beneficial.  However, I recognize that there is always room for improvement.  I grew up in Seven Oaks and I went to school in this division.  Now that I have my own family here, I want to give back to the community that helped shape me into the person that I am today.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Being the only province in Canada where the School Trustees set the taxation rate, I will push for a change in how the Public School system is funded so it is less of a burden on the ratepayer.  I am a firm advocate for transparency and accountability.  I will strive for an open and fair budget process.</p>

<p>I look forward to bringing my unique and innovative solutions to the Seven Oaks SchooI Board Office.  As a representative of the new generation, my fresh perspective can bring forth the positive changes that our community needs.</p>
