class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>After living in Winnipeg for the past 10 years, and managing a large City of Winnipeg department, I feel I have more to offer as a Councillor which will help shape Winnipeg&#39;s future as there is always room for improvement and I want to make sure all my residents voices are heard. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>With over 21 years of experience in municipal government and managing the largest mosquito control program in Canada, I feel I have more to offer as that experience from inside government gives me the edge of having a working knowledge of how a city needs to grow and function.  Couple this with being a small business owner, I feel It provides the voters with a wealth of knowledge that can be effectively used to work with all levels of government and civic administration to improve Winnipeg. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Widen Pembina Underpass - To widen the Pembina Underpass to three (3) lanes going north no matter what the end result of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) becomes; 
Waverly Traffic - To investigate the cost of an overpass or underpass at the Waverley St rail road tracks;
Widen Kenaston - To widen Kenaston to three (3) lanes in both directions from Taylor Ave to Academy Road;
Expansion of Bus Rapid Transit - To re-assess the BRT route and model to serve all residents of the City of Winnipeg;
Environmental Improvements - Increase the funding of the protection, monitoring and control of local and invasive species and diseases that are affecting the overall urban forest in Winnipeg; and,
Improve Emergency Access - To review the effect of the traffic circle installations that may be causing issues for Fire, Police and Ambulance services in getting to locations within our Ward.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The sense of community that can be found in pockets throughout but collectively can be strengthened and become a model for the rest of Winnipeg.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am running a campaign that is on a small budget as a sign of no ties to political parties.  I am relying on my website, signage and digital printouts for voters to consider me as their new Councillor. </p>
