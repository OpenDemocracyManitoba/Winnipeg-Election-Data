class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>Blessing decided to run partly because she likes to be part of the solution in making Transcona  vibrant and beautiful and welcoming. Hi Neighbour.
Feschuk focused on being Transcona&#39;s advocate for fresh, friendly and fiscally responsible ideas and solutions.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>Blessing is coming into this race with many years of working with vulnerable people including seniors with health issues. She has worked in the Health Care Industry for over a decade, mostly as a Health Care Aide worker. Working in the health field has  has seen the importance of having an advocate and the right people caring for you, and she plans to represent the Transcona ward by not only being a voice but to see that practical solutions to the issues that concern residents are addressed in a timely manner.
Her education and work experience has expanded her knowledge in the following areas: Health and Safety, Budgeting, Labour Relations, Business Law, Conflict Resolution, Collective Bargaining, Communication, Human Resource Management and Project Management. Blessing is a driven hard worker who enjoys helping others and collaborating for the benefit of all. She hopes to address many of the issues that she has seen as a resident that have been ignored over the years. Blessing plans on bringing fresh ideas, practical problem solving, and fiscally responsible approaches to city council. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Common Sense approach to developing and managing our roads.
Before beginning any road repair or construction, make sure the communication, gas, sewer and water lines are checked.
Why waste money by tearing up the road one year and then the following year having to redo the same road again.
No brown water please
Street light need to be checked more frequently for faults and better synchronizing timing.
Cost effective and timely snow removal.
No New Taxes - I am against the 1% Municipal Tax.
Parks where did all the neighbourhood parks go?</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>&quot;Proud Transcona resident who will serve my ward and the City of Winnipeg through practical and fiscally responsible solutions.
Hi Neighbour.
When new residents move into the area having them welcomed into the community helps strengthen Transcona and Winnipeg.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Voting is a Blessing Vote for Blessing!</p>
