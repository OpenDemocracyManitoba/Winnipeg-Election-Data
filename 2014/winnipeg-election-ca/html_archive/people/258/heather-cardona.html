class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I am running for the Board of Trustees because I believe in a strong public education system that is accountable to the community. The Board of Trustees sets the direction and the tone for the Division. Our policies need to reflect the values and the priorities of the community. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I am a homeopathic physician and mother in Winnipeg School Division who is committed to supporting a strong public education system. I understand that community begins in the classroom where our children are taught not only academics, but how to become integral contributors to our society as they grow.
I am an excellent communicator and will work hard for families, educators, administrators, and members of the community to enhance the education of children in our division. 
My interest in education policy comes from my family history of educators. In particular, my mother who started as a teacher went on to become a principal, then an assistant superintendent in Seven Oaks School Division. Her work taught me the importance of community in education and the vital role of the Board of Trustees in the policies and practices of the Division. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I will support policies that help to build strong learning communities which are inclusive, safe, and academically vibrant places for children to learn and to grow.  I will respect the values and priorities of our diverse community and I will work collaboratively with all who are engaged in this important endeavour.  </p>

<p>Some specific priorities I support include:
• Fair and open budget process
• Environmentally sustainable initiatives
• Full day kindergarten and nursery
• Use of assessment data to improve instructional strategies
• Professional development for teachers, support for children living with special needs
• Increased graduation rates
• Partnerships with universities and colleges to make courses available to high school students</p>

<p>As a Trustee I will be a careful and questioning steward of tax dollars.  I support an open, fair budget process and improved accountability to the public.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Winnipeg School Division has developed a mandate to make policies that support the growth of school communities that are inclusive, academically challenging, supportive and safe places where children and their families have a sense of belonging and many opportunities to grow and succeed. As a Trustee, I will build on this mandate. Schools should be safe and respectful learning environments. Neighbourhood schools should welcome all children and ensure accessibility to the buildings and programs. There should be many opportunities to engage parents and to enter into community partnerships that will enhance learning opportunities for students. Partnerships with cultural organizations, arts organizations, and other non-profits also enrich the education of our children and should be further developed. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am running for the Board of Trustees to serve my community by working with families, educators, administrators, and members of the community to support and strengthen our public education system. As a life-long learner, I am respectful of differing viewpoints and will work with integrity to find policies that focus on our common values and shared intention to provide the very best education for the children of Winnipeg School Division.</p>
