class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>My vision is one where all the stakeholders’ issues are resolved in an open pragmatic dialogue. Ideology needs to be kept out of the Board of Trustees, as our children’s future and all of the stakeholders’ futures rest upon making the best decisions.   I believe in building community consensus, where opponents and proponents of the issues work together to produce motions to the board.  The Winnipeg School Division belongs to all the residents within its boundaries, and they all should be represented.
I have regularly followed the Winnipeg School Division’s Board of Trustees meetings, policies, and general conduct.  The lack of recorded votes, the over use of in camera meetings, the policy choices, and the lack of real public input needs to change.<br>
I am ready to work as a school trustee on many fronts and issues: to vote for recorded votes; to vote for less closed door meetings, to maintain lower taxes, to make decisions that are in all the stakeholders (children, parents, taxpayer, educators, and societies) best interests not for politicking or personal gain, and mostly to ensure our children receive the best possible education. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I am a small business owner, educated in Business Administration from Red River College.  I have controlled large budgets in two heating ventilation and air conditioning businesses as an owner, and in a beauty supply company as a shareholder.  I am experienced in finance, accounting, and management, from owning three businesses.  Finance is very different when it’s your money that is being spent.   I sold one of the businesses in 2011, this allows be the time to be a great trustee. I have researched frame funding and have a good knowledge of its mechanisms.   My business background would be an asset for the financial operations of the Winnipeg School Division
I have my Red Seal Journey person status in Air Conditioning and Refrigeration, gas fitters license, and an electrical license. My familiarity of building construction, mechanical systems, and the operations and maintenance of buildings would be valuable on the Building/Transportation Committee.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>The taxpayer has to be recognized as partner in the public school system and needs to have predictable school tax rates.  Adding all day nursery kindergarten will increase taxes up to 17% when fully implemented as the provincial government has not committed to funding it.  I believe the taxpayer needs tax increases to remain within the rate of inflation.  The provincial government’s recent increases in the Education Property Tax Credit should not be erased by the Board of Trustees.
I am a parent of a special needs child, and I am supportive of practical initiatives to improve the education and care of these children. I support inclusion into regular school programming for special needs children.  The Special needs programs provided by WSD are exceptional, and I believe the residents of WSD are proud of their accomplishments.  I want to ensure the continuation of these valuable programs.
Inclusion for me includes diversity and respect of each other, I support in anti-homophobia legislation.  I support the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and support the existing human rights and anti-homophobia initiatives of the Winnipeg School Division. We need to give children a world where they can be safe, accepted, and successful.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I have lived in the River Heights- Crescentwood neighborhood since 1967, attending Robert H. Smith, Ecole River Heights, Kelvin, and graduating from Grant Park School in 1982.  I am married to my wife for 18 years, and our 2 children attend school in the division with my son at Grant Park High School, and my daughter at Lord Roberts Elementary School.<br>
Our daughter has mild seizures, and we have peace of mind knowing that the staff at Lord Roberts School will meet any needs that she will have.  You can sense and see that the staff cares about children.  There are many great staff members employed by the division, in all areas including; Principals, Teachers, Education Assistants, Therapist, Administration, Reading Clinicians, Psychologists, IT, Custodial, Building Services, and many other occupations.<br>
The Winnipeg School Division has a rich history with my family, my late father graduated from Isaac Newton in 1941.  It would be a honor to serve the public, and to return the schools back to the all of the public.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>The residents and voters of River Heights have a higher than average turnout at elections.  They research the candidates before making their voting decision and tend to make smart choices.  The River Heights voters are center and center right, a place that I am on the political spectrum.  I became a Progressive Conservative member in 2011, after the P.S.T. increase.  The increase was a disappointment in that the government promised not to raise the tax, and then bypassed the referendum legislation.  I believe that Liberals and Progressive Conservatives have the best policies and platforms.  I believe many people in River Heights do not favor labor endorsed candidates, and prefer the center.
