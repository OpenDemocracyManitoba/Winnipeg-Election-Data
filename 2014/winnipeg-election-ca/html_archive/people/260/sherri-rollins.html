Rollins.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a href="/pages/13/frequently-asked-questions#candidate_info">how we decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I was asked to run by a group of concerned parents, grandparents, and community leaders who had their own reasons on why they thought I could meaningfully contribute – some of those you can find on my website SherriRollins.ca - in the form of endorsements.  I am the mom of three children in the division and for this reason I wanted to care and serve the school division.  Ultimately, I decided to run because I want to work with parents, educators, administration, community leaders, volunteers, and the new team of trustees to increase student success. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>Public engagement, consultation methods, program delivery, policy analysis, and program review is what I bring to the board. Day to day I have been responsible for bringing communities and government together in creative ways to get work done.  I currently work as a Policy Analyst with the Manitoba government.  I have over fifteen years of public sector experience.  I have been a business woman, co-owner of a non-profit, and a for profit company that among other things surveyed the first national event for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  I am a reliable community volunteer.  </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Education is key to our economic prosperity and growth as a city, and as a province.  I stand for safe and inclusive schools; strengthening home and school partnerships; bullying prevention; services for students with special needs; arts education; continuing the work on full day kindergarten; changing the system so there is less reliance on property tax; improving transparency and engagement.
Over the past fourteen years of marriage my husband and I have opened our home to nine teenagers as they moved into the city for post-secondary or secondary school.  I am familiar with the impact of chronic underfunding of on-reserve education and its impact on the school system in particular.  I was Vice President of Literacy Partners of Manitoba and a volunteer tutor including English as an additional language tutor.  I am an Aboriginal woman and there remains a lot of things to work on.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I appreciate that ward 1 residents expect to be served well on all the issues and that they expect a school trustee that can effectively build the relationships required to serve not only the ward effectively,but indeed the whole school division.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Oui!  </p>

<p>Je croit que fondamentalement, l’éducation est la clé de notre prospérité économique autant que pour la croissance au niveau de notre ville que pour notre province. Comme un analyste principale des politiques à temps plein, avec plus de quinze ans d&#39;expérience dans le secteur public, je suis responsable de rapprocher les communautés et les gouvernements - de façons créatives. </p>

<p>Moi puis mon mari Darcy, a trois enfants qui sont tous inscrits à la Division scolaire de Winnipeg. Comme la plupart des parents, la majorité de mes activités de bénévolat présents impliquent mes enfants et la communauté. </p>

<p>J&#39;ai une conviction profonde de défendre les écoles sécuritaires et inclusives, les partenariats entre les familles et le milieu scolaire, la prévention de l&#39;intimidation, les services aux élèves ayant des besoins spéciaux et l’éducation artistique. Je veut travailler avec les parents, les éducateurs, l&#39;administration, les dirigeants communautaires, les bénévoles et la nouvelle équipe de fiduciaires pour augmenter la réussite des élèves.</p>
