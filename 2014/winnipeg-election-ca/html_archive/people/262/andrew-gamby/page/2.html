class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>As an educator I have noticed a discrepancy in the quality and availability of student programs and services from school to school. These discrepancies need to be addressed to ensure that every child is provided with an equal opportunity to succeed within our education system. I am running for the position of School Trustee to advocate for kids and make a positive change in our community through more effective education.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>As a teacher I have recognition of what is taking place in classrooms and in schools. A recent report by the Council of Ministers of Education indicates that students in Manitoba are scoring last among the provinces in math, science and reading. It is clear that we require change. It is important that the people who are approving budgets and allocating funds to schools and student programming have a background in education and a real understanding of what is taking place in schools and classrooms. I also have executive experience serving as the chairman of a board for a major condominium complex. In the position, I have gained experience working alongside others to enact positive change within a community. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>My vision for our education system is that every child receives the opportunity to become successful and gain the education and skills required to become contributing members of society. This vision requires a system that better addresses the unique needs of students at a base level. Educational inequality is prevalent in our system for a myriad of reasons and I intend to advocate for a system that is more equitable and that meets the needs of every student. I truly believe that education is the foundation of our society. Through more effective education we can proactively address many issues that negatively impact our society today.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Every school catchment in the Winnipeg School Division has a unique and socioeconomically diverse student body. Children and families from different backgrounds and ethnicities come together to makeup the educational community. This leads to a greater level of empathy and understanding of different peoples and their unique circumstances. The division itself is very representative of a multicultural society which leads to greater of acceptance of difference. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>It is important that we recognize as a community the need for change in our education system. It is clear that kids are falling through the cracks. Maintaining the status quo is not an acceptable approach. People with experience and a true recognition of the challenges we face need to be given the opportunity to promote and work towards positive change in our system. </p>
