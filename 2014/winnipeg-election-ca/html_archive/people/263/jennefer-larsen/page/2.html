candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I have two children, 6 and 3 years old. I have volunteered in their daycare program and nursery classrooms and contributed to Kindergarten snack schedules. While I enjoy these engagements I would like to do more to positively influence their educational experience as well as the educational experience of generations to come. This is my underlying, broad, motivation. 
Why now? There are big decisions facing the Winnipeg School Division now and in the near future. School structures are reaching a point in their lifespan when capital investment is necessary. Capacity in some communities is reaching a maximum. French Immersion enrolments have been increasing. There are decisions that need to be made by a Board of Directors that is skilled, experienced and modern enough to make them. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I have been privileged enough to hold positions on the Board of Directors for Lord Roberts Community Centre for 5 years and Sustainable South Osborne Community Cooperative for almost 3 years, providing me with experience in board governance. I have organized community clean up events, sought and supported grant and private funding for programs and initiatives, and assisted in coordinating a Community Consultation between the City of Winnipeg and the Lord Roberts community on the topic of the Fort Rouge Railyard Development.
I have worked for 13 years in the public health sector, 10 of which have been with one employer. 
I grew up in South Osborne and decided to raise my own family in South Osborne. I feel that my over 20 years of experience as a constituent, including attending area schools, provides me with a good understanding of the socio-economic needs and values of our constituents. 
I have experience volunteering with the Green Action Centre and Winnipeg Folk Fest and experience attending South End Advisory Committee Meetings as a High School Student Council President.
I maintain good relationships with City Councillor Jenny Gerbasi and Minister of Education and Advanced Learning James Allum. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I will support the continued provision of an early education free Nursery program. Research has shown that preschoolers that are engaged in peer level social interactions and early exposure to reading and writing perform better in K-3. The school division has the means to make this programming accessible, efficient and cost effective for families.
I will support the continued development of Outdoor Learning Spaces at our elementary schools. I will support educators&#39; attendance in personal development, such as the Manitoba Nature Summit. I believe that children are dynamic learners and there is much to be learned from the natural environment.
I will support a health curriculum that is informative, accessible, inclusive and age appropriate. 
I am concerned about the use of social media in high schools. I will promote the establishment of policy that protects the rights of students and educators to a safe educational experience, in its physical and online environments.
I will promote a re-evaluation of school bus service and ride lengths. I believe we can do better than have children sit for 1 hr. rides to and from school.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The Winnipeg School Division covers a wide range of socio-economic constituents. I believe that this lends itself to an educational experience celebrating diversity and inclusion. I wish to represent this belief in the division&#39;s policies and operations.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I welcome constituent conversation and have organized several Coffee Chat evenings open to the public, to meet me in person and discuss whatever questions or concerns are on their minds pertaining to the Winnipeg School Division, on October 2 at Lord Roberts Community Centre 7:30 - 9:00 p.m., October 7 at Lord Roberts Community Centre 7:30 - 9:00 p.m. and October 9 at River Osborne Community Centre 7:00 - 8:00 p.m.</p>
