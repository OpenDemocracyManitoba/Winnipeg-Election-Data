Winnipeg - 4 School Ward race</a>.</p><p>There are <a href="#recent_news">97 recent news articles</a> that mention Lisa Naylor.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a href="/pages/13/frequently-asked-questions#candidate_info">how we decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I work and live in Ward 4 and I have a teenage daughter who is a student in the division. I&#39;m directly in touch with the needs of my community and I have a special interest in the mental health and healthy body image of children and youth. The education system can play a critical role in nurturing the development of children&#39;s self-confidence, emotional strength, problem-solving skills and other factors that influence mental health; that perspective needs to be represented at the board and I look forward to creative engagement with educators and families on these issues. My primary roles throughout my career have been as a counsellor and health educator with youth.  I have also been an advocate for social change.  Systemic change is required to address the social problems and inequities that contribute to individual issues.  After years of working with youth and families, I am ready to contribute to sustaining  a strong and healthy public school system in which children and youth from all backgrounds can reach their full potential.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>A trustee needs to think critically about a wide range of issues, listen to the needs of a diverse range of people, and make tough decisions that best represent the needs of the community.  The experience and skills that I bring to the role of trustee are more important than my stance on any specific current issue.  You can read my detailed biography at my website www.lisanaylor.ca  and a brief summary follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am a professional communicator. Central to my work is listening to people&#39;s problems and communicating effectively with others.</li>
<li> I participate in ongoing education  to help me be respectful and competent in my communications with people whose culture or life experiences differ from my own.</li>
<li>I use consultation and research to make well informed decisions.</li>
<li>I work to consensus while not being afraid to stand alone on important issues. I am direct and articulate when challenging the popular opinion and asking tough questions.</li>
<li> I excel at problem-solving, mediation, and decision making and have experience with facilitation, supervision, and evaluation.</li>
<li> I have extensive experience with committee work at the local, provincial and national level and have served on other Boards of Directors.<br></li>
</ul>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Appropriate specialized education programming for students with exceptional and special needs ensures that all children can reach their full potential.</li>
<li>Music, arts, physical education and cultural activities complement and enhance academic learning. </li>
<li>Aboriginal perspectives should be integrated into all aspects of educational endeavors to support cultural competency and increase respect for Aboriginal culture and historical heritage.</li>
<li>Newcomer students and their families require effective support and programs to ensure they have an equitable chance for success. </li>
<li>Schools need to be body-friendly environments where people of all shapes and sizes are included and respected.<br></li>
<li>Board information, business practices and decision-making processes should be visible, easily accessible, accountable and open to participation.</li>
<li>Trustees must be committed to community engagement. A school board and its schools are intricately linked to the lives of families, to the local community, to the province and to the larger global community.</li>
<li>School administrators need  to engage in pro-active outreach to specific communities that are not currently well represented on parent councils, committees or present at school events.</li>
<li>Professional development should be provided to all staff members to strengthen cultural sensitivity and increase teacher-parent liaison skills</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The diversity of Winnipeg School Division students presents many challenges yet it is our greatest strength.  20% of WSD students identify English as an additional language and approximately 23% of families with school age children in the division are Aboriginal.  Many of our students bring lived experience from all over the globe and study side by side with children from families who have lived in Winnipeg for generations.  Efforts are made for inclusive education opportunities for children with varying abilities and learning challenges. This diversity can be respected and capitalized upon in order to help students  develop the skills of empathy, respect for difference, and community responsibility. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>As your trustee, I will bring the fresh perspective and the passionate energy of someone who is new to civic leadership while also bringing 25 years of experience and demonstrated skills as an advocate, leader, thoughtful decision maker and skilled communicator.   </p>
