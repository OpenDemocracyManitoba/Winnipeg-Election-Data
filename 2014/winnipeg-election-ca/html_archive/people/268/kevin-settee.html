class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I decided to run in the School Board Election because I believe and understand that everybody in our education system has a gift. I believe that our education system has the potential to nurture the gifts of students, teachers and educators so that we can have pride in who we are as a human beings and working citizens. We need to use our gifts whether we are a leader, skilled tradesman/tradeswomen, writer, mathematician, educator, counsellor, athlete, learner or teacher to install pride and hope in each other so that we can evolve into critical thinking and skilled working citizens. I would love to fulfill my duties and gifts by advocating and working on behalf of the community on the school board so that residents, students and employees involved in the Winnipeg School Division have their needs and gifts respected in our schools. I love my community and the dynamics, demographics and needs of Ward 5 are continually changing, as a School Board we need to be understanding of these changes and make informed decisions as school trustees.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I am Anishinaabe/Ininew and as a life long community member of the west end, I have shared and lived experiences with community members and students. I am a Greenway and Gordon Bell lifer, I can bring a youthful and well experienced community based voice to the table. As a former lacrosse player of Gordon Bell and as a lacrosse coach now I understand the importance of physical literacy and sports teams to schools. It is vitally important that students and educators not only focus on strengthening their mental capacity and understanding but also strengthening and maintaining their physical health. I am currently studying Urban and Inner City Studies, Religious Studies and Geography at the University of Winnipeg. The Urban and Inner-city Studies Department at the University of Winnipeg has and continues to equip me with valuable critical thinking skills and knowledge on the dynamics, issues and solutions to the inner-city of Winnipeg. The valuable knowledges and experiences gained in the UIC department are an asset in my candidacy for school trustee in Ward 5. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Here are some of the issues and solutions that I stand for in my role as a School Trustee</p>

<ul>
<li>Inclusive education for Aboriginal peoples, newcomers, special needs students, and gifted and talented students.</li>
<li>Further development of Aboriginal Language Program, in-school and after-school programming including transitional classrooms, off-campus programs, tutoring, and   mentorship initiatives.</li>
<li>Expansion of the role of student advisory committees at both a local and divisional level.</li>
<li>Establishment of a Student Leadership Centre to provide added supports and resources to young people.</li>
<li>Expansion of land-based education curriculum to encourage sustainable development knowledge and practice.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important that the school board recognizes the learning needs of each and every student. Expanding and being more inclusive of student bodies at the divisional level will strengthen and support decisions being made on the school board. </p>
