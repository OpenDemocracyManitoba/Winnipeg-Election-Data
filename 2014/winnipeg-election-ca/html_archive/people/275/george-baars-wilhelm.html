class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I have been approached over the years to get involved in politics. Lately those voices asking me to participate have been growing stronger. People I talk with are tired of the same old, same old at city hall. They want city hall and councillors to act responsibly. They want cooperation at all levels, and they are tired of the bickering.</p>

<p>I want to be the next city councillor in Transcona.  I want to bring new and fresh ideas to City Hall. There are many challenges to tackle, but I know with your support I can be part of the change needed at City Hall. I want to represent the best interests of the people of Transcona.  </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I believe my strong skill to listen and to care about peoples needs sets me above the others. My experience working with a political party, non-profits and community groups gives me a greater understanding of what makes a community thrive, grow and prosper.</p>

<p>Working in the private sector and having run my own business gives me the business prospective. Throughout my career in the non-profit world and in the private sector I have learned to approach issues in a very balance manner.</p>

<p>I have held a number of board positions, ranging from Board member to Chairperson, with a diverse range of organizations. I know how important the volunteering is to the community.</p>

<p>Transcona needs a strong voice, with new and fresh ideas to continue on the path of growth, renewal and sustainability, that will continue to make Transcona an amazing and thriving community. I can and want to be that voice at city hall.</p>

<p>My campaign material says “ Let George Do It”</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Fixing City Hall:  Create a more cooperative city hall, partnering and working together to get the job done. </p>

<p>Fiscal Prudence: It is your money and city hall must be more fiscally responsible with the resources it oversees. </p>

<p>Seniors Concerns: With our growing population have to work with all stakeholders to come up with tangible plans on increasing/building affordable housing units.</p>

<p>Rebuilding Infrastructure: City Hall and Council must prioritize and come up with better ways to do infrastructure repairs. There needs to be more planning between City Hall, its departments and other stakeholders, such as Waste and Water, Manitoba Hydro, and others.  </p>

<p>Improved snow clearing: Sidewalks need to be cleared to concrete, and snow removal in back-lanes must be done more frequently and thoroughly. People with mobility issues, health issues and seniors will need safe clear sidewalks in order to make it safely to these new community mail boxes.</p>

<p>Off-leash dog areas: I want to work with WINDOG and other stakeholder and create a working group to come up with a plan to create and sustain off-leash dog areas throughout the city. Every region of the city should have several areas where dog owners can let their pets run free. </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Transcona is a wonderful community. I think the one thing that I have seen over the years is the communities’ resilience and caring. We care for our community and the people living here. It is a place where neighbours talk and watch out for each other. It makes me proud to be living is such a community. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>While going door to door talking with the people of Transcona they had many things to say.</p>

<p>People don’t like the way city hall works, they would like to see the bickering stop and for things to get done.</p>

<p>They are very upset in the way our snow clearing is done. It is even more important to have sidewalks “cleared to concrete” because Canada Post is implementing community mail-boxes.</p>

<p>They are annoyed with the 311 system and would like to see it revamped or dismantled.</p>

<p>They would like to see the city do a much better job in rebuilding our infrastructure</p>

<p>The citizens of Transcona want city hall to stop wasting resources</p>

<p>Transcona needs a strong voice, with new and fresh ideas to continue on the path of growth, renewal and sustainability, that will continue to make Transcona an amazing and thriving community. I can and want to be that voice at city hall.</p>
