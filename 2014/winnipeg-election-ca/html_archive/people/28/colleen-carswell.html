class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I want to continue my work as a School Trustee, to make a difference in the lives of children by ensuring that they are educated to their fullest potential, always keeping in mind the ability of our taxpayers to pay for that education.  It is truly a balancing act; you can’t have one without the other.  I believe in supporting initiatives in the Early Years to help build a strong educational foundation through programs such as Reading Recovery, and Early Numeracy; and, at the Middle and Senior Years by focussing on student achievement through relevant programming and assessment.  I want to continue to provide a safe and healthy environment in which all of our children can learn.  It has been, and will continue to be my goal to help parents deal with their concerns by being a full time Trustee, devoting all my energies to my Trusteeship, being accessible, and approachable to parents.  I want to continue to work with staff to ensure that the necessary resources and supports are in place to support our children.  I want to continue to be a strong voice for my community of Transcona at the board table.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I bring 22 years of experience as the incumbent school trustee.  My track record demonstrates strong leadership, proven ability, effectiveness, and the dedication of making school trustee my full time job.  I have both negotiations and financial background and experience.  I have been Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Board; I have sat as the Chairman or member of many school board committees.  I have sat on committees at the provincial level for education.  I bring both leadership skills and I work collaboratively with others.  I bring excellent communication skills, common sense and a genuine caring for children, staff and my community of Transcona.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>The first issue is the inequity in educational funding that exists within the province.  This needs to be addressed so that equity and fairness are achieved both by the school divisions who receive the funding and by the tax payers who are paying for it.  We need to lobby the government to create a new process for collecting school taxes and distributing them fairly and equitably across the province.</p>

<p>Secondly, would be to continue to assess the practices and programs that we have in place as a division for students.  Our world is ever changing; the work force and universities demand certain skills and abilities, as a division we have to make sure that we are adapting our programs so that we are preparing our students for the future.</p>

<p>Thirdly, would be to continue to work on our Divisional Communications Plan.  We need to determine the best way to communicate with parents, what information is important, how to share that information in a timely manner, and what role technology plays in that.  Those questions need to be asked and answered for all the stakeholder groups so that we have an effective and efficient means of communication.  </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The one thing that I appreciate the most about my ward, the Transcona Ward, is the history, pride and sense of community that we have here in Transcona.  We are truly a community unto ourselves.  To represent the ward of Transcona has been a great honour.  The people of Transcona support public education and have supported me for the past 22 years and for that I am truly grateful. </p>

<p>As for the school division of River East Transcona, I truly appreciate the people that work there.  The staff that work within the division are dedicated to making this division the best it can be so that we can educate our students so that they can attain their fullest potential.  We excel in the area of being “educational leaders” in assessment, curriculum implementation, student services, technology, and Early Years intervention.  These accomplishments can only be achieved through the hard work and dedication of the staff of the River East Transcona School Division.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I want to thank my community for the privilege they extended to me four years ago.  Serving as your Trustee has been extremely challenging and rewarding.  Given the opportunity, I will continue to dedicate myself wholeheartedly to the role of Trustee, mindful of the concerns of all the partners in education; students, parents, educators, and taxpayers.  The future holds many challenges and issues for education.  You will need an experienced Trustee with a strong voice to ensure that our schools and programs do not diminish.  Our school system must provide quality educational opportunities for every child.  As your Trustee, I will continue to be a strong advocate for our schools.  I will continue to ensure that your tax dollars are spent effectively and efficiently.<br>
I am committed to:
• Being a full time trustee who is dedicated to representing your interests in a strong and effective manner.
• Ensuring fiscal responsibility and accountability to taxpayers by striving to balance the needs and opinions of all those I represent.
• Providing our children with a safe, stimulating, and healthy environment in which to learn.
• Creating strong partnerships with parents, staff, and the community within the Division.</p>
