class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I decided to run in the 2014 School Board Election as I am dedicated to education and believe my years of experience as a teacher, administrator, Faculty Advisor, parent and grandparent make me an ideal choice for School Trustee.  I have participated in all facets of education and had my finger on the pulse of the education system for over 40 years.  I was approached and encouraged by many people including many of my University students, parents and colleagues in the education field who said I should run for school trustee as I have so much valuable experience to contribute to the role.  I always wanted to be a school trustee as I have enjoyed such a wonderful teaching career and want to give back to the education system in Winnipeg.  I want to share my passion for learning with the next generation of learners.  I possess firsthand experience in a wide range of educational environments ranging from elementary to post secondary, and I want to share my knowledge and experience with the families, students and educators in this division.  Throughout my career I have sat on various Boards and Committees in Winnipeg, and bring a wealth of experience.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>During my long career in the school division I have taught grades 3 through 12 as well as at Red River College and the Adult Centre.  Currently, I am a Faculty Advisor at the University of Manitoba, Faculty of Education, where I help train new teachers.  In addition, as a parent and grandparent, I have participated in the education system from both sides of the coin.  I was a pioneer in the field of Adult Education in Manitoba where I both developed innovative programs and built a strong rapport with learners, parents, colleagues and the community at large to foster learning in a broader sense.  I guided the implementation of 50 community education programs across Winnipeg.  I possess a lifetime of educational experience that I am eager to bring to the Pembina Trails School Division.  My Husband and I were instrumental in bringing the Winnipeg Technical College into existence and we were proud to be invited to their very first graduation, where my husband addressed the graduates.  We recognized the importance of such an institute, as all students need a way to realize their potential. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I am a great advocate for fairness, compassion and judiciousness.  I believe we should try to recognize the value in each child and find innovative ways to bring out enthusiasm for learning.  Every child is unique, and we have to work together to develop supports so that all children have the same educational opportunities.  I am also a tax payer in this division so I am motivated to see that these tax dollars are invested in good education.  I am absolutely against any form of bullying.</p>

<p>We are now seeing how poorly many of our students are doing in the PCAP.  I believe that the basics must be taught in reading, math and science.  This should be a priority in the early years of school.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I appreciate the open and accessible dialogue of this Division and the genuine concern of the parents.  I feel that communication is of utmost importance between families, educators and School Trustees, and I will make myself accessible and work tirelessly to advocate on behalf of the students and their families.  Parents are the best advocates for their children, and I will work with them to ensure that their concerns and ideas are brought forward and taken seriously.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I was the recipient of the YMCA - YWCA 2014 Woman of Distinction Award for Education, Training and Mentorship.  This award was given to an educator who inspires a passion for personal growth, development and life long learning through the education system as well as improves the lives of the students in their community.  I am a team player and respectful of differing views.  I will work to get the best educational programs for the students of Pembina Trails.  </p>

<p>I possess Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Education, and Master of Education degrees, and my education combined with my experience make me an ideal candidate.</p>

<p>I would appreciate your vote on October 22nd.  </p>

<p>Let a lifetime of educational experience work for you!</p>
