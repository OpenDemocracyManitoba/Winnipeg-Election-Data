class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I have always been interested and passionate about education and education systems. To be involved at the policy level would be inspiring and very rewarding.  I feel I have a lot of experience to make informed decisions and look forward to learning. I will be able to represent the tax payer from not only a lateral position but with my experience, an internal one as well. I will strive to be a voice for the students and families of our division. I am approachable and understand what our divisional citizens expect from our representatives. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I have been a life long resident, student, parent, volunteer, Education Assistant and Teacher in this division. I feel I will bring a broad viewpoint from my roles and experiences. I work with my head but also with my heart. I can understand where our students and community members are coming from as well as offer an educated perspective. I have a lot of pride in my community and school division and believe we are first in our class! I look forward to using my well rounded knowledge and skills to impact the future of our schools and the students. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I would like to see a focus on early education through in-school nursery programs. Early years are so important for future learning and attitudes about school. If we have the chance to impact students in the classroom at 4 years old, we can increase literacy, numeracy and cut down on behaviour issues due to learning difficulties. We have excellent pre-school (0-4 years old) programs that can still support an in-school nursery program. </p>

<p>I would also encourage better emotional/peer supports for middle years. By taking a proactive approach as early as elementary, as opposed to a reactive one, we can offer programs and supports for students with social and emotional difficulties.  This can follow students into the most difficult time of adolescence.</p>

<p>In our high schools, we need enhanced apprenticeship partnerships in our vocational programs. Actual workplace sponsors are needed to encourage interested student in careers in the trades. We have it on paper that we are doing this but it is not transferring into real life situations. </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>We have a very supportive division. We empathize with families on school of choice requests, classroom placements and many schools encourage open communication between home and school. We offer students many choices for language, career or university streams and programs of interest such as band, arts, and vocations. We are in the forefront for offering educators many opportunities for professional development and personal growth. There are chances for career movement, and encouragement for added responsibilities within the school. We strive to put students needs above budgets, although this is a reality all divisions face.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I pride myself in being an active community member. I believe when we all work together, we are able to bring many well rounded perspectives and experiences to the table. Building relationships benefits everyone through team work, collaboration, and building comradery. Communication on all levels is important for transparency and building of trust. </p>
