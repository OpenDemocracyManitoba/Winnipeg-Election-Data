class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I strongly believe that retired educators are both an untapped and under-utilized resource which school boards need to take advantage of.  Educators are the ones working &quot;in the trenches&quot;, so to speak, on a day-to-day basis.  I decided to run for the elected office of school trustee because I believe I have a lot to offer ... insight from the aspect of both a teacher as well as a parent.  School Boards make major decisions that affect students and the communities they serve ... I feel that my years of experience as an educator would be an asset as a member of the board of trustees.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve been an educator for over 30 years (now retired) ... with 19 years in the St. James-Assiniboia School Division. Over the years, I&#39;ve taught at most levels between nursery/kindergarten up to middle school students.  I was involved with the St. James-Assiniboia Teacher Association, both as a school representative as well as sitting on the Executive Board for several years.  I have two grown boys that went through elementary, middle and high school here ... both graduating from John Taylor Collegiate.  I have years of experience within the St. James-Assiniboia School Division, both as a parent and a teacher. I served several years on the St. James-Assiniobia Teacher Association Executive Board.  I am a life-long learner with strong leadership skills.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I understand the importance of working collaboratively and unilaterally with our community, teachers, administrators and members of the Board of Trustees in order to establish policies that reflect the progressive values of the community such as inclusion, diversity, accessibility and academic excellence for our children.  Student safety, both to and from school, as well as within the wall of the school should be a top priority.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The one thing that I appreciate most about the St. James-Assiniboia School division is it&#39;s diversity.  </p>
