we decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>My original intentions for running in this 2014 municipal election was to become a 22 year old youth mayoral candidate in this race to represent our demographic eagerness to have a voice in the political process.  Like Mayoral candidate Robert-Falcon Ouellette talk about with AYO politiX we need to start challenging the already perceived notions of the perception of how the world actually is. One thing Ouellette did not mention is that to have a perception of the world you need a perspective which is another word for a viewpoint.</p>

<p>I studied politics during my time at the University of Winnipeg and in my introduction to politics class my professor said this to the class... There is no view from nowhere. What that means is ideas you have in your head don&#39;t just come from nowhere. People develop there own sense of the world through education and through learning experience. The perception out in the world is that young people are apathetic in politics. Well I want to challenge that perception by gaining more real life experiences by starting out at the starting position at a grass root level of a political career as a school trustee at seven oaks.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>As a young person who doesn&#39;t really have as much real life experience compared to some other candidates for school trustee that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have any qualifications that exclude me in the process to do my very best and try running for school trustee. It is a worthwhile learning experience that can help me educate myself in how the political process actually works and to get involved within my community where I have lived all my life ever since I could remember. </p>

<p>As a recent graduate at Maples Collegiate in 2010 I was awarded with the United Way Community Service Award from 08/09 for all the school groups and extracurricular activities I was involved in. I have worked with several staff members and schools board members in the past with my participation on the organizing committee of the 7 oaks school division Unite To Change conference. I am also very well known by most of the staff at Maples Collegiate I was known as the make a difference guy which was because of the make a difference project that I started in my grade 10 year which was about getting students actively involved within the school and community.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>There are several issues that needs to be addressed and discussed during my time on the school board but as one out of four elected school trustees I don&#39;t want to solely focus on the issues. </p>

<p>It&#39;s about finding the answers and putting the solutions made by the public and community into actual actions. There are four major issues I think as a young person and as a recent graduate of the school division who went through them in the position of a school trustee that we need to addressed are the lack of political education, bullying awareness, mental health, and community volunteerism.</p>

<p>These issues have a very important place in my own personal life and are all issues that students are facing during there time as a student in the grade school system and these are important societal issues that should be address as early as possible in the education system.</p>

<p>Theses issues also play a huge part after students graduate from School. My passion in life is politics, was bullied a lot during my entire time in the school division, also had to deal with depression and anxiety but during high school I got involved in the community.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The one most important particular thing I apreciate about both the school ward and school division is the fact that the 7 oaks emphasizes the slogan &quot;community begins here&quot; which is one of the reasons community volunteerism is a pillar in my platform. </p>

<p>One of the ways that help me overcome depression and my childhood dealing with bullying was the fact that I got involved at maples collegiate students groups for example like student council, the maples unity group, the amnesty group, asian heritage, and yearbook committee as a chief photographer.</p>

<p>The divisions excels at hiring an equal amount of professional leaders and passionate mentors who meaningfully care for the students educational studies and programs. They offer good facilities and extracurricular activities to engage the students in the community but...</p>

<p>The question I think needs to be addressed in the school division is... &quot;How many students are participating in the community themselves based on each students own merits?!</p>

<p>For myself the most important lesson I have learned during my time in the school division was that I love to help other people and to not be afraid to go after your dreams no matter how tough the challenge must be.</p>
