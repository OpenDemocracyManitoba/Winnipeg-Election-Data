class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I decided to run in the 2014 School Board election because I want the SOSD to be a leader and model for other school divisions. I want:
• Students enrolled in the division to excel academically and become well-rounded and compassionate members of society who value each other (cultural diversity) and the planet
• Parents to choose public schools because they provide top quality education
• Teachers and support staff to thrive in a safe, positive, and supportive work environment, 
• The school division to embrace the larger community – beyond just the students and their families. 
Like many residents of Seven Oaks, I may not have a direct connection to the school division through my own children or grandchildren but, I have extensive knowledge, skills, and expertise to offer. As a resident of Riverbend since 1992, I have also contributed thousands of dollars directly to the SOSD through school taxes. I want to analyse how the school division’s annual budget of over $125 million is being spent on various education programs, initiatives, and priorities. I want to ensure that community members are kept well-informed of the Division’s spending priorities, strategic and capital plans, financial position, programs, initiatives, and accomplishments. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>Educator: During my 33-year career in environmental education I have developed and delivered curriculum-based education programs to thousands of students (from pre-K to university). I am familiar with the Pan-Canadian science curriculum for all grades. As an adult educator, I have trained hundreds of teachers within my specialization (science, physical geography, ecology, natural history, water, watersheds, and wetlands). I am a graduate of UW’s English as an Additional Language Teacher Certificate Program which will provide unique insight into Adult EAL programs in SOSD. 
Management and Policy: I have extensive experience with the creation and operation of an educational facility – including strategic planning, setting standards and policy, hiring educators, risk management, and program development and evaluation – all of which would complement my role as a school trustee. I have experience writing policy related school programming (teacher to student ratio, use of volunteers), human resources (wages, job descriptions), public education, facility operation, and safety.
Board Governance: I have training and experience as a director on several management boards – including Nature Manitoba and the Canadian Water Resources Agency – Manitoba Branch. This has given me knowledge and practical experience with board governance and the roles and responsibilities of board members. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>As new trustee, I will delve into many issues:
• What will SOSD do to improve student performance in science, math, and literacy? Are science experts and resources available to assist K-8 teachers who do not have this background?
• What are the policies related to instruction, evaluation, and assessment (including homework and student testing)? 
• How does the SOSD compare to other divisions (standardized test results, space/student, cost/student, number of mixed grade classes, student to teacher ratio, etc.)?
• Does policy protect and promote human rights (anti-bullying, integration and support of LGBT students, etc.)?
• How are communicable health issues (lice, bedbugs, illnesses, etc.) handled? Does policy respect individual privacy, prevent stigmatization, minimize spread, and increase awareness/understanding?
• Does the SOSD have a comprehensive emergency plan – beyond fires? 
• What are the human resource policies (training/qualifications, professional development, compensation)? 
• Does resource allocation reflect the revenue sources for special programs (e.g., French programming, adult EAL)? 
• How much is spent on transporting students to/from school versus transportation for educational purposes? Are dedicated buses/drivers used for field trips? Is there a  “Safe route to school plan” for all schools?
• How is technology used to enhance teaching and evaluation?</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Several years ago, the school division made a bold decision to break with tradition and invest in the creation of a natural wetland and prairie habitat on the site of a future school (École Rivière-Rouge). This project – located on the historic Frog Plain – was proposed as a valuable addition to the teaching resources of the school division as well as a community asset. It is located within an easy walk of West Kildonan High School, École Riverbend, and Red River Community Centre. It has huge potential to re-connect urban children with nature (through interpretive signs and activity nodes), provide recreational opportunities, and serve as a safe active transportation route to and from school (once the perimeter trails are installed). I would like to see the school division recognized for its foresight in moving beyond the usual playgrounds and lawns to create this unique educational space. This type of project is particularly important today as most children grow up and live in urban environments. It is particularly important for new Canadians to have opportunities to experience and learn about the natural and cultural heritage of their adopted land. It is this type of vision that I wish to represent.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>As an education specialist with experience from outside the formal school system, I will bring a unique, fresh, and independent perspective to the school board. I understand the needs of educators but I also have experience from the program management perspective (risk management, cost efficiency, etc.). I will not be hampered by how things have always been done in the past.  I am willing to take things apart (through analysis) in order to create new and better ways to reach the overall goal. Because I do not have children or grandchildren in the school division, I will be a strong advocate for all children. I believe that every child is equally important and that education must build upon each student’s unique abilities, interests, and strengths. As an environmental educator, I have a particular interest in promoting opportunities to reconnect children of all ages with nature within their community. This includes the adoption of natural playgrounds rather than traditional playgrounds, developing outdoor classrooms on school grounds, and developing a plan/policy to support outdoor education. It also involves replacing “fear-based” policies (that discourage or prevent teachers from organizing valuable educational activities beyond the classroom) with policies that focus on educational outcomes.</p>
