Broda-Milian.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a href="/pages/13/frequently-asked-questions#candidate_info">how we decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>• Education and the public school system have been my life.  I taught in Winnipeg School Division (WSD) for 33 of 34 years of my teaching career, and retired in June, 2014. </p>

<p>• The role of school trustee is an opportunity to continue contributing to the public education system. My dedication to education remains strong. I believe my abilities, education, expertise, and experience, combined with my desire to continue contributing to the education system, make me a worthy candidate.  </p>

<p>• The timing is right in that I can bring to the WSD Board table an up to date perspective of life in WSD schools. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>• I have a Bachelor of Education and Masters of Education in Curriculum as well as holding certification for School Administration.</p>

<p>• Winnipeg School Division is organized into four districts of schools.  I have taught in all four, in various roles, including: Classroom (Grades 4-8), Computer (Grades K-9) and Special Education (Grades 4-6).  </p>

<p>• As a Special Education teacher, I was the Case Manager and advocate for my students - liaising with: parents/guardians, school team, clinicians and social agencies.</p>

<p>• I&#39;ve served on several Boards. During my tenure as President of Biathlon Manitoba, a significant amount of time was dedicated to creating and updating policy – which is also a primary function of school boards. </p>

<p>• Over the years, I supported the endeavors of our children in school and the community in various volunteer, coaching, and officiating roles, including biathlon officiating at the 2011 Canada Winter Games.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>• transparency of Board process</p>

<p>• accountability for decisions, budgetary matters, policies and direction of the WSD board</p>

<p>• accommodation of all students’ needs - academic, emotional and physical, providing the supports they need to be successful</p>

<p>• the effective and efficient management of resources</p>

<p>• working cooperatively with and for all stakeholders</p>

<p>• I am interested in both the funding and focus of the WSD Clinical Support Services (CSS), formerly the Child Guidance Clinic (CGC).  More specifically, the wait times/frequency for students to receive the preventative, consultative, diagnostic, and intervention services of CSS clinicians is the concern.  </p>

<p>• Student transitions from Early to Middle and then Senior Years.  Within this concern is the manner in which student achievement/needs are both communicated and subsequently addressed.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>• My family and I have been community members of Ward 2 for over three decades and have connections with each school in the ward.  I was a teacher at Fort Rouge.  Lord Roberts, Riverview, Churchill and Collège Churchill were all attended by either my wife Jackie, our daughter Ksenia or our son, Kiernan.</p>

<p>• I appreciate the diversity of our student population and the opportunity to provide an appropriate learning environment for the success of each and every student.</p>

<p>• Ward 2 is a “gift” to whoever becomes school trustee.  With only 5 schools and the Diagnostic Learning Centre in the ward (all close to my home), the opportunities for dialogue with all stakeholders, in and out of school, are many.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>• I am not affiliated with, financed, or influenced by, any political party – provincial or federal.  My top priority is that we educate whole students - providing the academic, emotional and physical supports they need to be successful. One can best attend to the role of school trustee without party affiliation working to influence votes on the WSD Board.</p>

<p>• Recently retired, I am able to commit the time and energy necessary to fulfill the role of school trustee.  This is especially significant in a time of transition when the majority of Board members elected will be new trustees and public expectations regarding transparency and accountability are, rightly, heightened.</p>

<p>• My campaign is completely financed by my wife and me.</p>

<p>• I am extremely grateful to my supporters, and appreciative of those who have been able to volunteer their time on my behalf.</p>
