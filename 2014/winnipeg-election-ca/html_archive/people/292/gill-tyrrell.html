Election?</h3>

<p>I work for Opportunities for Employment as an Employer Liaison. My job is to find participants in our Employment Mentorship Program, long term meaningful employment. Unfortunately for many of our participants, the lack of education is their biggest employment barrier.In my role as a School Trustee l would ensure that every student that graduates from our division has developed a  skill set that will enable them to enter into; post secondary education, vocational training or choosing a career that will enable them to be valuable contributing members to our community
.
I believe that the LRSD has gone through some extensive and needed changes but now it is time to embrace these changes. l believe my skills as a mediator and negotiator can enable me to strengthen the relationship between the LRSD and it&#39;s school community in three areas; 1 relationships, to create an environment of trust and mutual respect, 2 ensure that communication is open and honest at all times and 3 to ensure that whenever possible all financial decisions are transparent in their intention.</p>

<p>My skill set would allow me to add value to the LRSD. It would be a pleasure to become part of the LRSD board.  </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I have served on a number of advisory boards, holding different positions and responsibilities, both as a volunteer and in a professional capacity. I strongly believe that my; education, work and volunteer experience has enabled me to bring a skill set  that will bring value to the LRSD and all of its stakeholders. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>As a School Trustee l would like to stand for accountability and responsibility to the students, staff and school community. I would like to help create a positive  teamwork environment where the best interests of all stakeholders is first and foremost. I would like to create a social conscious in our students that is based on the foundation of; empathy, diversity and mutual respect.</p>

<p>I would like to ensure that financial disclosure is transparent in the allocation of funds. I would promote open dialogue between all stakeholders.I would like promote the input of the P.A.C. I would like to promote the relationship between the business community with the LRSD community by implementing practicum opportunities that may evolve into paid placements for students on a part time basis and full time once a student has graduated.</p>

<p>I know that there has been a lot of work done in the area of French Immersion schools within the LRSD, l would like to ensure that the positive relationship is maintained and that there is never a division between our French immersion schools and our English schools. </p>

<p>I would promote more teacher professional development opportunities that would enable our teachers to teach relevant curriculum&#39;s.   </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>There are many things l appreciate about the LRSD and its school community. I am very impressed by the feeling of ownership that the school community has for its school division.Throughout my campaign l was often challenged on questions asking me &quot; What abilities and values will l bring to the LRSD. I am very impressed by the number of candidates within ward 3 and the passion that we all share to want to assist the LRSD in continuing to grow, to address the needs of their student body and to maintain a strong and positive working environment between the division, the board and the school community.</p>

<p>I am very impressed at the way the LRSD values diversity, in its student body&#39;s cultural and ethnic backgrounds, in its curriculum variety and in creating a positive learning environment in a very social economic diverse student population . Teachers in the division have told me they view diversity in its many forms, as an opportunity to enrich and engage students in the learning process, to connect with the school community and to embrace the value that diversity brings to all parties involved in the LRSD.  </p>

<p>LRSD is a welcoming, caring learning environment</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I believe that as a result of my work and volunteer experience along with my diversified education, l have the skill set that would allow me to bring value to the LRSD as a School Trustee. I am a good team player and often are put in the position of a  leadership role by earning the respect of people l am working with. I have an extensive proven track record of achievements where my efforts have been recognized and l have been awarded for.</p>

<p>As a result of being an Employer Liaison, l believe my most valuable characteristic l have developed is empathy. l have seen first hand the many different life obstacles one is challenged with by not having an education. I truly want to change that by ensuring that our students are equipped to address any employment challenges they may be confronted with.It is essential to be qualified in such a competitive employment market.</p>

<p>I am a driven individual that can be dependent upon to complete any task that l am given and to always exceed expectation. I look forward to the opportunity of being part of the LRSD and earning the trust of the school community. </p>
