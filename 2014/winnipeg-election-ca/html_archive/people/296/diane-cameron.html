class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I have been a life long resident of the Seven Oaks area.  I experienced our schools as a student and for over 30 years as a teacher. Our division has grown and changed dramatically in this time, first with the Maples area, then Riverbend  and now with the development in Amber Trails. We are very much a multi-cultural division and need to intentionally build our communities around the common school experiences of children and their families. I have experienced the results of decisions made at the board level with regard to staffing, administration, buildings, grounds, student support and curriculum implementation. My experience instructs me on how such decisions affect children.   The education and well-being of children and their families is my greatest priority and has always guided me as a teacher.  I want to continue to make a positive contribution to the Seven Oaks School Division and thus have chosen to become a school trustee candidate.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>As a taxpayer in the area I respect the necessity of making few dollars go a long way.  I know that there are some areas that can be tweaked to release funds that can be used to assist students in real and immediate ways.  Support for students can look very different on paper and as it translates into a classroom setting.  Supporting children and especially those with challenges is an area in which I have real experience and understanding.  </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Schools must take a leadership role in supporting parents of young children.  Financially this is prudent as money spent on programs for young children, statistically preclude larger expenses spent later on older children who have “fallen through the cracks.” This leadership can be in areas of care, nutrition, literacy, numeracy, play and exposure to nature. I believe our families are ready to work with the schools in order to help their children become the best they can be. We currently have some fine programs but must reach further into our communities in order to expose more children to the opportunities available.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Our division and particularly this ward is made up of children and families from all over the world.  Some communities are larger and more visible than others.  We must build on this cultural richness by increasing understanding and respect for all.   At the same time we must intentionally teach and create understanding and respect of our home in Seven Oaks and how it has evolved over the last three hundred years. Seven Oaks has a rich history that has been an integral part of the building of our province and nation.  All citizens should be respectful of this history and of our peoples as they in turn become part of Seven Oaks from many places in the world.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am an INDEPENDENT candidate. I have not asked for nor received outside funding from any political or organized groups.   Should I be a successful candidate for the Seven Oaks School Board I will pledge to take each and every discussion and decision seriously with no preconceived notions.  I will endeavor to find out all aspects of a situation and vote independently and with my conscience, keeping in mind the aim is always to benefit the children of Seven Oaks School Division. As a teacher my children experienced my care for them and for their families.   I am running for a school trustee position so that I might be in a position to effect change as I  CONTINUE TO CARE for the children of Seven Oaks School Division.  </p>
