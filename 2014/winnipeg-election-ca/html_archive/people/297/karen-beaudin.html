Election?</h3>

<p>I am running for school trustee to be a part of a team of leaders who have the capability to ensure the success of all students in the Seven Oaks School Division.  I have children who attended and are still attending school.  I have experienced and learned how things could be improved in order to provide success for all students. I have served on many boards and feel I can bring my knowledge and experiences to the Seven Oaks School Board.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I have been a resident of the Seven Oaks community for the past 24 years. I have five children, one still attending school,and two grandchildren.I graduated from the University of Manitoba with a Bachelor of Arts Degree,a Certificate in Management, a Human Resources Certificate and recently a Bachelor of Social Work Degree. Education is important to me and I would like to ensure that education is accessible to all.  My community work includes sitting as aboard member of the Seven Oaks Hospital Board (2009), chairperson of the Parents in support of Aboriginal Education and Vice-chair of Ikwe Widdjiitiwin Inc. 
Our parent group worked hard to bring“Keeping Balance” an after school program into the Seven Oaks School Division. In the last eight years we have been successful in obtaining funds for “Keeping Balance” and provide successful after school programming.
I was recognized by the community and received the City of Winnipeg “Community Service Award”. Any opportunity to have a conversation with community members, parents, and students is welcomed. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<li>The school division must ensure that 90% of our class sizes are capped at 20 students or less and no K to 3 classrooms will be permitted to exceed a class size of 23 pupils. </li>
<li>  Bill 18, the Public Schools Amendment Act (Safe and Inclusive Schools). This bill amends The Public Schools Act in the areas of bullying and respect for human diversity. If elected I will ensure that the written policy concerning respect for human diversity/bullying is implemented in each school and ensure that the appropriate use of the internet to include social media, text messaging and instant messaging.</li>
<li> Based on recommendations from the Manitoba Association of School Superintendents position paper on Aboriginal Education (2011), the recommendations from the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996); The  Board of Trustees adopted an Aboriginal Education Policy on April 22, 2013. 
Policy. I will ensure that there is opportunity for parents/guardians/community, students and educators to have on-going input into as well as assessment and evaluation of<br>
targeted funding which may include AAA – Aboriginal, Academic Achievement Grant and BSSAP – Building Student Success with Aboriginal Parents.
These are policies that have been implemented in the school division.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Seven Oaks School Division is a diverse community and the opportunity to learn and share cross cultural awareness is a very important piece of education for all; community, educators and administrators.</p>
