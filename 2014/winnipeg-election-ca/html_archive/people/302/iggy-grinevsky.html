Election?</h3>

<p>I decided to run in this upcoming election because I wanted to make a difference and be a voice for the kids, parents, teachers and for the administration. I have been volunteering in the community for the last 20 years in work sharing programs with students and been coaching basketball at every level(high school, community, district and the Filipino league). I fee that my people skills and having a close relationship with parents and students make me an ideal candidate . This district has a vast cultural diversity and ethnicity. I want to be active in the community and serve all people. I owned businesses in the area and support daily the community and district. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>*20 years of volunteering in the community as a basketball coach and assisting with work education programs for students. 
*7 years of University. B.A in Economics and a B.A in Administrate Studies.
*Management positions in past work experience
*Market Analyst
*Budgeting and Forecasting
*People skills and a positive attitude
*Mentoring and being a role model
*International experience teaching and working with elementary kids, students and high schools. I was a teacher in  Korea in 2004
*2012 Subway coach of the month for the Province of Manitoba
*Congratulation letters and certificates from Mayor Katz, Manitoba NDP Caucus and Member of Parliament in Ottawa</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Some of the issues that I would be targeting would be:
*Health and fitness
*Safety for our kids. Stop bullying and assist with depression. 
*Fundraising for programs and extra circular activities after school.
*A breakfast program to feed kids who fall under the category of under privileged groups or under represented groups.  No kid should go hungry to school.
*Provide basketball camps for free during summer months to kids in the community. I am a certified National basketball coach with national certifications. 
*Tackle gang issues and drugs in the school system.
*Offer a program to reward exceptional students
The safety and welfare of our kids and student is extremely important to me. Also, to encourage healthy living and to participate in extra after school activities to promote team work and responsibility. As an active individual who takes health and fitness seriously I want to be active in the school system. I will personally donate $250/month if elected to deliver healthy meals to a classroom that has shown the greatest grade improvement and good work ethic. I will deliver those in person and will sit and listen to the kids and have lunch with them.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I want to represent fairness to all levels of schooling and education. I want to be an active voice of the community and serve the district in the most efficient manner. I feel that in the past school trustees are only representing the district in meetings with the School Board and most parents or students have no contact or communication with them. I want to be the voice of the people in the school division; to actively participate in programs, attend sporting events, talk to teachers, meet with principals, help students and parents and improve the overall educational system in the area. I truly appreciate the diversity of the community in ward 4 and I want to represent all  groups. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I have been in the newspapers and T.V regarding my active work with kids. Please feel to read some of these articles:
