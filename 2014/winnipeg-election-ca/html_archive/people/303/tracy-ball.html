Election?</h3>

<p>Having worked and volunteered in various schools for more than 16 years I have seen changes in the education system that are disturbing. The lack of real communication between schools and parents is a trend that needs to be addressed. 
We need to have school trustees that have worked and been involved in the education system as it brings a real understanding to the working situations that trustees deal with. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I have worked in Winnipeg School Division for more than 15 years. I helped to create a Breakfast program in a middle school as well as running very successful fundraisers at all of the schools where I served as Parent Council chair.
I am also the President of Sinclair Park Community Centre. As such, I am used to working with various styles of budgets and working with others to bring about vital changes that are required to ensure sustainable programs as well as maintaining fiscal responsibility.
I have also served on several Board of Directors, such as the Hepatitis C Canada Board of Directors, and my daughters daycare Board of Directors. 
Having worked with such diverse groups has allowed me to learn how to find realistic working solutions to problems and how to report back to the stakeholders that these decisions effect. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I want to focus on 3 major areas.</p>

<p>The first is the lack of funding available for families who have children who&#39;s learning abilities are challenged for various reasons. These children need access to Educational Assistants that are critical to helping them succeed in school and in life. These children and their families need to know that they aren&#39;t alone. </p>

<p>The second is to ensure that we are fully utilizing the volunteers that are so vital to the education system. Over the last several years many parents and other volunteers have not felt welcome in many of the schools. All of the studies show that students who&#39;s parents are involved in the school did better in school. As little as 10 years ago, it was standard to see volunteers in many of our classrooms, now there are next to none. We need to bring them back and ensure that they feel welcome and respected by all levels of the education system. </p>

<p>The third area is accountability and accessibility of school trustees. It is imperative that as elected officials there is a dissemination of pertinent information that affects the electorate in our ward. </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Ward 8 of the Winnipeg School  Division is such a culturally diverse area. This diversification allows for the opportunity to grow and expand our understanding and acceptance of others that are culturally different from ourselves. 
Winnipeg School Division has created programming that recognizes the needs of children who require specialized education to ensure that they are supported and encouraged to reach their full potential. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>No have interacted with parents and families for yearsans heard concerns that  must be acted on. We make a promise to educate these children and we are failing them. These children are our future and we need to invest in them. </p>

<p>I want to be that voice that ensures we do our best to create and support a system that meets the needs of all of our children while ensuring the fiscal responsibility and accountability to all of the voters in the area.</p>

<p>I want the voters to know and understand what we are doing at that affects them and their families. 
There were changes made last year to the Ward system that voters are just learning about now. </p>

<p>This election, Winnipeg School Divsion will only be electing 1 person per Ward where in the past they elected two or three. More than ever, it is imperative to vote for a person who will represent the Ward in a way that ensures the concerns of the Ward are heard, a person who can work with other Trustees and be respectful, bring forth real issues that affect our children. I will be accountable, available and involved in the community.  </p>
