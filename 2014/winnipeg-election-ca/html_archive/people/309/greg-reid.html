decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I have enjoyed my time representing the residents of Ward One in Seine River School Division since first being elected in 2002. For the past 12 years, I have been active at both the divisional and community level. I remain passionate regarding the role of public education in preparing students to be responsible and contributing citizens in their communities. Together, our Board, staff  and community stakeholders have been able to improve public education for students in our division, and I look forward to continuing to be a part of continued improvement through innovative and evidence-based decision making.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I bring my experience as a School Trustee, having served for the last twelve years on the Board of Seine River School Division. I also bring my experience as a senior leader in a local Regional Health Authority, having worked in varying roles in the healthcare sector for the past 23 years. Additionally, I bring my experience as a leader and board member in various community organizations in Manitoba and Canada.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I am a strong believer in inclusion, and will continue to advocate passionately for a continued emphasis on inclusion in all schools. Normalizing the educational experience for students with special needs has proven to result in improved outcomes for all. I also believe strongly in the importance of providing expert psychosocial and emotional support for students as part of the educational experience. We continue to experience new challenges in our communities in this regard. I believe we need to continue to partner with other community stakeholders in order to ensure we are in the best place possible to respond to the growing mental health concerns of our students; this will need to involve continued emphasis on stigma reduction and education on mental illness and mental health for both students and staff alike.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I believe that our Board has proven to be innovative and open to new ideas. This has meant working closely with our senior administration team and ensuring that the lines of communication between employee groups and the board are open and that dialogue is ongoing. While we have a strong track record in this regard, all partners will need to continue to work to find ways to improve communication and dialogue toward improving the quality of the educational opportunities we provide for the students in our division. We are fortunate that parent involvement is strong in our Division and we boast many active Parent Advisory Councils. The Board needs to continue the connection with these community based groups in order to ensure the way forward is consistent with the concerns and goals of local communities and their families.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I have a proven track record for providing timely response to questions and issues for the residents in Ward One. I will continue to advocate at the Board level for improvements based on evidence and support to community and grass roots level initiatives which are student-centered and represent improvements for public education in Manitoba.</p>
