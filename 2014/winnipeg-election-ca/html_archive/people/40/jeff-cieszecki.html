<p>I have been involved with the education system for over 29 years across Manitoba in varying capacities (coach, community volunteer, educational assistant, classroom teacher, and parent).  During that time I have had the opportunity to work with other educators, community members, various levels of government, and international partners in creating unique learning opportunities and educational policy for students in Manitoba.  As a community member and working within the system, I feel that this is a natural progression for me to continue my passion for the promotion of education as a school trustee.  </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I feel that it is important that a school board have representatives with experiences from working within a classroom.  From my work as a teacher, I would bring an understanding of classroom issues, ongoing educational research, and policy development.  Specific areas of work in schools that I have been involved with include social justice, appropriate educational programming and Aboriginal education.  As a teacher association executive, I have worked with superintendents, school trustees and teachers to create a supportive work environment, and schools that welcome all students.  I am an experienced contract bargainer and have committee experience related to Provincial funding of schools including the Financial Reporting and Accounting in Manitoba Education (FRAME) and the Funding of School Programs (FSP). </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>It is important that the Board continue to support the work that goes on in our schools to create an inclusive environment for all students.  It involves communication with teachers, administrators, clinicians and other support staff to ensure our students have the resources needed to excel in school.  The Division needs to continue its work on creating safe and inclusive schools by addressing issues of equity and social justice.  The Division needs to continue developing strong ties with post-secondary institutions to assist with student career opportunities.  There also needs to be greater community input into divisional decisions, as some of these decisions have a great impact on students such as the recent move to include grade 9 at River East Collegiate and subsequent reconfiguration of feeder schools.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>River East Transcona has a long history of academic excellence and high graduation rates.  This is accomplished through programming such as heritage languages (Ukrainian, German, and French), International Baccalaureate and Advance Placement programs, performing arts, sports, and vocational programs.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>As a parent of a child presently enrolled in the River East Transcona School Division, I can appreciate the concerns of other care givers in area in regards to the educational experiences of our youth.  I will bring my experience as classroom teacher and educational leader to work towards meeting the needs of our students.  I look forward to working on behalf of the community of Ward 2 in the River East Transcona School Division.  </p>
