class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I feel that I have not finished the task I set for myself, namely to ensure a superior educational system for our future citizens.  I firmly believe that education is the relentless pursuit of excellence and “not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.”  W.B. Yeats</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>My experience includes my previous 15 years as a Trustee, as well as 3 terms as Chairman of the Board.   I also hold a Certificate in Public Sector Management from the University of Manitoba, in addition to my studies at the Faculty of Architecture.   As a previous small retail business owner for 18 years and a retired provincial civil servant, Administration &amp; Finance, also 18 years, I am familiar with the workings of large organizations.   I have also sat on numerous City, Provincial and University Boards with mandates of policy, governance and budgetary concerns.   </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I feel that it is long past time for a serious discussion on the future of education in this province.   I mean a frank open discussion at the highest levels, with the actual stakeholders, with the purpose of creating a plan and a direction for next five years.   Not some blather or bafflegab about “the future” but a concrete set of proposals and at the end, and most importantly, an evaluation on whether we achieved them.<br>
Every aspect should be on the agenda: funding, taxation, structure, staffing, governance, assessment, achievement, politics and more.   Frankly, I’m tired of the earnest cliché “children are our future” without someone actually putting forward a plan to ensure that they, and us, have a future.
I believe we need a concentrated effort to improve our graduation rates.     Why after 12 years in the system are students failing to understand what they have been taught?
I believe we must examine our Pass/Fail policies to ensure that students have the knowledge and confidence to advance to the next grade.   We do them no favour by passing them simply because it’s time.<br>
I believe we need a unified effort to root out drugs and pushers in our schools.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The diversity and composition of the ward, it’s almost a microcosm of the city itself.   Within this mosaic of culture, language, religion, socio-economic factors and diverse opinions, I am gratified by the willingness of many people to work and share together.   Big hearts willing to take on big jobs.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am an independent candidate and will not bring a personal agenda to board business.   I am not indebted to private organizations seeking favours, or special interest groups within the education system.   I do not represent a political party, nor have I accepted donations, assistance, information, labour or influence from a political party.   I do not pretend to be an independent.   I am an independent, and accountable to the electorate as a whole. </p>
