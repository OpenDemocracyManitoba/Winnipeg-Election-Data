class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>With three experienced trustees not seeking re-election in 2014, as well as the passing of Trustee Shirley Timm-Rudolph last year, the time did not seem right to retire. Experience is very much required as the division is in the midst of a number of initiatives, including the 20K3 implementation, the grade nine integration at River East Collegiate, the automotive conversion into a performing arts music room, and the bus transportation facility review, and strategic planning, just to name a few. The division is also making changes in divisional communication strategy and senior succession planning. My years of experience will be invaluable, as new trustees come on board, and we work toward consensus.<br>
    I have much to contribute, as mentioned with my experience, passion and dedication. I have not missed a regularly scheduled board meeting in the past 10 years. Last year I had 15 requests to bring greeting at grade farewells and graduations, I was able to attend all but two. I support many sporting, musical and celebration events held in our schools. I devote my full-time attention to advocate for the children, parents and taxpayers of our school division.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>Peter’s School Board Experience
• Since first elected, Peter has taken on the serious responsibilities of Board Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Board of Trustees. He has also served as chair or member of every standing committee, including Finance, Building and Property, Program and Policy, Negotiations, and Technology.  Peter also served on a number of Ad-hoc committees, including, Senior 1 Location Study, Board Strategic Planning and Senior Administrative Selection.
• Peter has served as Provincial Regional Director on MSBA.
• Peter is a past member of Provincial K-S4 Physical Education/Health Steering Committee.
• Peter can identify with Senior Divisional Administrators, Principals and vice, Directors, many teachers, and many other important stakeholders within the system.
• Peter is very familiar with all 42 schools, having visited them numerous times over the years, as well as the maintenance and transportation facilities and the off-campus areas.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I stand for a safe, caring and nurturing environment, where children are encourages to excel. I strongly believe, every child deserves the opportunity to reach their potential, and use the experience gained as stepping stones to a brighter future. I include my home telephone number in my election brochures, because I feel taxpayers must be able to talk to their elected officials. I&#39;m knows as someone who asks many questions, and always challenge those in a position to make positive moves, could it be done better, and never settle for &quot;good enough&quot;. I expect constant improvements as we journey on. </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>If there is only one thing, I appreciate the warmth and sincere well wishes of the people of Ward 4. My ward is quite large, the ward boundaries run from Glenway  Avenue in the North, Kilcona Park to the South, Springfield Avenue to the south and the Red River to the West, with a little notch on Henderson Highway. I have walked my total area, and talking with as many people as I could, often hearing &quot;you are the only politician to have ever come to my door&quot;, or folks greeting you at the door saying they will be supporting me before I even hand them my brochure, also hearing small children say to their moms and dads , &quot;this man always comes to my school&quot;. Since I am asking the fine folks of North Kildonan for their support and vote, I feel strongly I should than also be the one coming to their door. The school children of my ward are the reason I do what I do.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Dear Neighbours,
    The future holds many challenges and issues for education, and the public school system must provide educational opportunities for all children. As we struggle with declining enrollment in some schools, aging schools, limited resources and ever changing technology, we can never forget our citizens expect the best value and return for their  educational tax dollars.
    As your full-time dedicated trustee, I pledge the River East Transcona School Division will continue to provide excellence in education from K to 12, with strong family values in a safe caring nurturing environment. I have the experience, passion, and dedication to ensure your children’s education interests are well represented. Nothing can be more important to our society than to ensure our children are well educated and prepared for the future.
    As Board Chair, it has been an honour representing you, the people of River East. I truly enjoyed meeting so many of you during the various school graduation farewells, school sporting events or music/coral concerts to name a few. I also appreciate your phone calls and e-mails. 
    I stand in support of public education. On October 22nd, I humbly ask for your support, confidence, and vote, for school trustee.</p>

<p>Sincerely, 
Peter Kotyk </p>
