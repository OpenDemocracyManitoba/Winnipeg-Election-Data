class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I feel there are many issues that I raised in my first term that are unresolved and need to be raised again.  This, I feel would benefit all students, staff, parents and the rest of the community/the public.  I want to make public school boards public again.  I have a passion for education and want to see &quot;the real&quot; best practices being used in our schools. I ran on 4 basic issues in 2010 and want to continue, to improve these areas in 2014.  My 4 basic issues are 1. Safe, Healthy Schools, 2. More Open, Transparent, Relational, Accountable School Board, 3. Greater Parent / Resident Involvement and 4. Programs / Program Reviews.  <a href="http://edrhume.com">Please see my webpage</a> for my political platform and more details about me.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I feel a bring a wealth of experience to compliment my role as a School Trustee.  First, I am a retired teacher with 33 years of teaching experience.  Since retirement in 2007, I have continued to stay active in the classroom as a substitute teacher in 4 Winnipeg school divisions (last 7years) and am currently employed in them.  Over 40 years experience in the classroom!  Secondly I have 3 degrees from the University of Manitoba, Bachelor of Physical Education (BPE), Bachelor of Education (BPE) and a Masters of Education (M Ed).  Thirdly, I&#39;m a parent of 3 daughters who graduated from the St. James School Division.  Finally, I believe in professional developemnt for school trustees and try hard to stay current/ up to date by regular attendance at conferences/workshops.  </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Some of my issues include: the continued use of part time caretakers in St James at 10/15 of our elementary schools since 1994 when all other school divisions use only full day caretakers.  This issue in my opinion presents a health and safety risk which I feel would be unacceptable to the majority of the public who are unaware of this situation.  If re-elected I plan on taking a public petition back to the new school board to rectify this unjust situation!  Please go to my webpage (edrhume.com) for more detail.  Other issues in my opinion include: a governance change from the present use of the Business Corporate Model to the Parliamentary Model where individual trustees have more power to act on behalf of the community who elect them!  The whole area of special needs, needs to be re-evaluated.  In my opinion, we don&#39;t employ enough occupational therapist, and physiotherapists to help train and guide our educational assistants (EA&#39;s) who work daily with these students.  I feel a need for more open and transparent communication with the parents and the community.  <a href="http://edrhume.com">Please check my website</a> for my whole political platform and more detail about these previously mentioned issues.   </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>There are some great things happening in St. James-Assiniboia which I appreciate: 1. We have a very well trained, hard working and dedicated staff.  2. There are great opportunities for professional development for our staff through conferences and workshops.  Our division offers a wide variety of great programs including, strong athletic and musical programs, International Baccalaureate (IB program), solid vocational programing at Sturgeon Heights / St. James Collegiate and Jameswood Alternative School (only 2 exist in Winnipeg!)  We also have a strong technology program which includes a fibre optic network and Wi-Fi connections in all our schools.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am a candidate who believes in continual improvement of a school board, the status quo does not cut it!  Just like we expect improvement in our staff and students, school boards also need to improve, setting an example for their staff.  How can we tell them they need to embrace change and improve when we as a board don&#39;t set the example?  We need to walk the talk.  In St. James we have &quot;Great Schools for Learning and Growing&quot; but I want to make them the &quot;The Best Schools for Learning and Growing&quot; through the TEAM approach (Together Everyone Achieves More).  <a href="http://edrhume.com">Please visit my public website</a> for more detail. </p>
