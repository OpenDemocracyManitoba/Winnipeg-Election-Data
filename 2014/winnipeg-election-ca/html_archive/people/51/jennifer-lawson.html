class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I chose to put my name forward as a candidate for School Trustee as a direct result of my lifelong commitment to education and to my community. As a parent and educator, I am passionate about maintaining an effective public school system that meets the needs of all students. I hope to continue to serve St. James-Assiniboia, and maintain my focus as a dedicated, responsive Trustee, working on behalf of students, families, and the community.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>Professionally, I have been a teacher, consultant, vice principal, and principal, with experience working in urban Winnipeg, as well as rural and northern Manitoba. Most of my career in education was spent in Winnipegâ€™s inner-city schools. </p>

<p>Currently, I hold three professional positions. I teach in the University of Manitoba&#39;s Faculty of Education, training aspiring teachers. I am also a professional writer, with an extensive collection of educational books, entitled The Hands On Series, published and implemented in schools across Canada. My publisher, Portage and Main Press, is a local company that specializes in Canadian content and professional books for teachers. </p>

<p>I am also a current School Trustee in the St. James-Assiniboia School Division, having completed my first four-year term in this role. I am the Chair of the Personnel Committee for the School Board, and spent three years as the Chair of the Education Committee. I have also served on a variety of School Board Committees, including Marketing, Early Childhood, Awards and Scholarships, Board-Teacher Liaison, and the St. James Scholarship Foundation.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<ol>
<li>Support all students in meeting their potential through effective educational programs, including academics, the arts, athletics, trades programs, and special education. I believe that our public school system must provide a balance of programs in order to meet the needs of all students.</li>
<li>Seek ways to serve an increasingly diverse community population. The community of St. James-Assiniboia is changing in terms of demographics. </li>
<li>Enhance connections between schools and the community by supporting family centres, child care, recreation programs, and community organizations. I see the public school system as a community-based institution and, as such, we must work together with other organizations to cooperatively serve our citizens.</li>
<li>Keep the needs of students and the community first.</li>
<li>Maintain fair and equitable school taxes. As a School Trustee, we have been put in a position of trust. That means that the public has put their faith in us in terms of being fiscally responsible.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Over the past four years as a School Trustee in the St. James-Assiniboia School Division, I have come to appreciate the positive culture that exists at all levels of the organization. Furthermore, as I have been active in this campaign, the citizens of this community have conveyed their very positive impressions of this school system, and they would like to see this same level of effectiveness and accountability maintained in the future.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I hope to continue to serve my community, and to ensure that our children are provided with a quality education, in a safe and secure school environment.</p>
