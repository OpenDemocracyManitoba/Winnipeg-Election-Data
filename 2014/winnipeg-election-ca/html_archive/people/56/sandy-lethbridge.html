candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I am seeking re-election in my ward.  I first decided to run as a School Board Trustee as I wanted to be the voice for parents with children.  I remain passionate in the belief that our children need to feel safe while at school and should want to be at school.  There must be a broad range of programs offered to our students including the arts, sports and special education.  It is really important our children are provided with the best options available.   Our children must be properly prepared to transition into the world after they graduate from our high schools.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I have always been active in the community including volunteering as a board member at the daycare centres my daughter attended – Fairlane Children’s Centre and Lakewood Children’s Centre.  I was a member of the Parent Council at Lakewood Elementary for six years.  I continue to volunteer Friday evenings to chaperone the dances at the Assiniboia-West Community Centre (even though my daughter has not attended for four years!) as well as volunteer duties at many different events held at the community club.  My daughter sang in the St. James Divisional Senior Choir and I have chaperoned most choir field trips and events for seven years.  I was the fundraising co-chair for the St. James-Assiniboia Divisional Choirs for three years.  I held positions of President, Secretary and Treasurer on the board of directors of Winnipeg Condominium Corporation #1 (Birch Park Condos) for 15 years.</p>

<p>I am the current Chair of the Education Committee, I am a member of Personnel Committee, Early Childhood Development, Marketing, Board representative for the Student Council.  I have been appointed by the Manitoba School Board Association as the representative on the Provincial Arts Curriculum Review Committee.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>The reason I became a School Trustee was to be an advocate for students, to have a voice and be the parents’ voice.  </p>

<p>We must ensure our schools stay focused on student achievement, safety and student wellness.  We continue to have a broad range of programs available including the Arts, Sports and French Immersion and assisting those with special needs.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>During my daughter&#39;s education in the division we were fortunate to have amazing teachers who taught her well academically, guided her and were always there for their students.  My daughter&#39;s grade four teacher from elementary attended their graduation ceremony as she wanted to see &quot;her kids&quot; graduate!  </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I grew up Crestview and live in St. Charles.  My parents and sister also still live in the area.  I attended Buchanan Elementary, Hedges Middle School and John Taylor Collegiate.  My daughter attended Lakewood Elementary, Hedges Middle School and graduated class of 2014 at John Taylor Collegiate.  My nephew is currently in grade 12 at John Taylor Collegiate.</p>

<p>I love being a School Trustee.  It has allowed me to stay involved in all aspects of the Division.  All of our School Division employees are an amazing, caring group and definitely have all our students’ best interests in the forefront.</p>
