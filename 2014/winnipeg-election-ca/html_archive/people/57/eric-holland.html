class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>Like so many of us, I could not believe what I was reading about the financial train wrecks and questionable behaviour occurring on what seemed like a daily basis at City Hall.  I grew increasingly frustrated over what I viewed as gross mismanagement and the failure of some City Council members and senior civic officials to do what is right.  I concluded it was time to take the step to enter the race to replace our current Councillor for St. Charles.  I feel Mr. Nordman is ineffective at representing the residents of our great area of Winnipeg or the city in general.  We need change, which includes a new Councillor for St. Charles who is acting in the best interest of the people of our neighbourhood and not one who is loyal to the Mayor and work only to fulfill their agenda and further their causes.  Mr. Nordman has been well rewarded for his unwavering loyalty, but that is not why St. Charles residents sent him to City Hall.  I believe my knowledge, experience and unwillingness to compromise my integrity equip me to take on what will surely be significant challenges facing the new City Council.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I have been employed by the Province of Manitoba for 28 years.  I hold the position of Standards Officer with the Procurement Branch - Department of Infrastructure and Transportation.  I am responsible for establishing the standards and developing specifications relating to the goods purchased across all government departments.  This ensures we receive maximum value for the dollars spent by Manitobanâ€™s and that we are purchasing goods which meet or exceed the requirements of national and/or international standards relating to quality and safety.</p>

<p>If selected by the residents of St. Charles Ward to be their representative on Winnipeg City Council, I will take this same attitude, work ethic and desire to do what is right with me to City Hall.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>My integrity, honesty and behaving in a way my family will be proud of are things I am not willing to compromise on and are certainly not for sale.  If successful on October 22nd I will take that belief to City Hall with me and fulfill my responsibilities with integrity and humility.</p>

<p>I have the experience and willingness to take on the challenge of reviewing and amending the purchasing policies of the City of Winnipeg.  For instance, the Chief Administrative Officer has had the authority to award a non-tendered, single source contract to a developer or supplier up to the value of ten million dollars.  From every angle you view this policy, it is absurd.  The external auditors tasked with reviewing questionable financial decisions made at City Hall agreed and recommended that figure be slashed down to one million dollars.  I believe that spending threshold is still much higher than it should be and I will work to bring this more in line with acceptable practices of other municipalities.  The current policy could easily be used to undermine the proven and accepted practice of fair and transparent competition through the open tendering process and I feel this needs fixing.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>This is an amazing part of Winnipeg.  So many of the residents grew up in this neighbourhood and when it came time to start our own families and purchase a home, we stay and do so here.  This speaks to the attitude we have about our neighbourhood and the quality of life we enjoy.  To represent St. Charles ward at Winnipeg City Council would be such an honour and I would serve with tremendous respect and humility for the privilege to do so.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>After working in government for 28 years, I feel I have the experience and skill to navigate what can certainly be a challenging and cumbersome bureaucracy.</p>
