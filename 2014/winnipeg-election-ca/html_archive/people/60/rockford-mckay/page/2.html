candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I am once again running for School Board election because I believe that education provides an equal opportunity for all to succeed in our society. Success may be defined differently from individual to individual, but public education should provide a place of quality and equity for all. My parents and grandparents always stressed the importance of education and hard work. I have come to see the opportunities education and hard work can bring. I owe much to my family and teachers for helping me find my own success. I have a passion helping our youth obtain their own successes. As a School Trustee I want to bring to the board my experiences and become part of a team to help other families and students find their successes.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I have been a classroom teacher and school science program consultant for over twenty years working with schools all over Manitoba. This has provided me with an opportunity to work with many diverse communities, all with its own needs and vision for the future.
I have been a School Trustee for St. James - Assiniboia from 2006 to 2010. In this time I worked on the Education and Finance Standing Committees. I also served as Chair for both the Education and Governance Committees.
I have served on many other boards and committees including Athletics Manitoba, Manitoba Runner’s Association, Manitoba School Board Association’s Committee on Aboriginal Education, Province of Manitoba’s Aboriginal Education Directorate Advisory Council, and the Province of Manitoba’s Technical Vocational Education Advisory Council. I presently sit on the Manitoba Schools Improvement Programs Board of Directors.
As a teacher I worked in the development of new curriculum and supporting resources that help teachers implement high quality programming. I am an author of the new Manitoba Grade 7 Science textbook. This textbook has been approved for use in all Manitoba classrooms. I am also a chemistry advisor for a new Manitoba Grade 10 textbook.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I believe in a strong local school board. A local school board can provide the best experience for students that reflect the unique characteristics of our community. As school board members, we live in the community and understand what is important to our parents, children and other community members. Programs such as French Immersion, Early Childhood education, and Special Needs education although not uniquely found in St. James – Assiniboia can have unique characteristics that reflect our local character.</p>

<p>As a long time educator I am very concerned about how our students are doing in comparison with other students in Canada. The latest PCAP testing results have shown that Manitoba students rank last in Math, Science, and Reading Skills in Canada. In 2010, Manitoba students ranked second last. How can we start making improvements? 
Although we do not know specific results for each school division, we in St.James - Assiniboia School Division can continue to do what effective schools do. Effective schools provide learning for all students. Effective schools focus on results. The effective school has high expectations, has strong educational leadership, collaboration, a clear mission statement, frequent monitoring of student progress, safe learning environment, and on task learning.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>St. James - Assiniboia School Division offers such a wide and diverse range of educational opportunities. Programs such as high quality academics, French Immersion, International Baccalaureate, Advance Placement, Technical Vocational, on – line learning, St. James Assiniboia Hockey Academy, Performing Arts, Cooperative Education, Early Childhood Education, and so much more provide for rich and varied educational opportunities. As a student these opportunities gave me the flexibility to explore a wide variety of experiences that helped me find my passion in life. Now as a father I still see St. James – Assiniboia School Division providing rich opportunities for my daughters to find their own passions in life.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I believe that our schools must not only prepare our children to succeed in our society but must also be able to compete globally. Our country is changing quickly. One of the major changes is our shift away from a manufacturing based economy to a more service based economy. If we are to grow and prosper as a country, we must continue to be innovators. I believe that our schools must enhance our student’s experiences in the areas of math, science and technology. In the early 1990s, I can recall hearing that by 2010, about 95% of the skills needed in the work force will require math, science and technology skills and attitudes. I find it difficult to think of many jobs that do not require these skills and attitudes. With our need to address the problems associated with our environment, health and future energy needs, we as a society must not only concentrate on literacy, but must become scientifically literate as well. To compete and prosper on a global stage, we must be innovators of these new technologies. This goal must start at our local schools and I would support this as one of our new challenges to meet.</p>
