<p>There has been much accomplished but much that needs to be done.Craig - </p>

<ul>
<li> Stands for ratepayers to ensure that taxes remain fair and that St. James Assiniboia remains one of those regions that are affordable through one of the lowest mill rates. This is more challenging as the Province provides near 0% increases to Operating Budgets for St. James Assiniboia for the three years. </li>
</ul>

<p>-Ensures schools integrate with neighbourhoods to involve everyone, especially seniors.. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Our schools deliver excellence for all students by promoting individual achievement. </p></li>
<li><p>Continues to work for greater action in literacy and numeracy,</p></li>
<li><p>Stands up for our students especially the needs of special needs students and for school bus safety through presentation of motions to the Manitoba School Board Association calling on the Province to provide the necessary legislation and faster action for infrastructure to support children. </p></li>
<li><p>Championed the School Resource Officer Program working with City and Police to ensure greater police presence at high schools. In fighting bullying and promoting safe schools, </p></li>
<li><p>Supported efforts to address the roots of bullying and has worked with Federal representatives to fight cyber-bullying.  </p></li>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>Craig Johnson serves the residents and families of St. James Assiniboia School Division as your elected Board Trustee. In addition, he serves as Chair of the Marketing of Education Committee and is a member of the Board Finance and Facilities, Personnel, Governance and Scholarship Foundation Committees. Craig has represented the Division with the Assiniboia Chamber of Commerce, provincially and nationally.</p>

<ul>
<li>Craig played a significant role in the construction of the St. James and Sturgeon Collegiate Tracks promoting ongoing infrastructure projects to benefit our community. </li>
</ul>

<p>Craig is an active post-secondary educator, instructor and Career Services Manager at a local Winnipeg College. He is aware of the educational and vocational needs of the future employers of our students. Working with adult earners from Winnipeg, rural and northern Manitoba and over 80 countries, Craig has developed understanding of our diverse society.

He has been a past Chair of the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce Education Committee and had been  with the Winnipeg Chamber.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>There is a large amount of work requiring both energy and experience. 
- Continue to support action to allow our students to benefit from greater literacy and numeracy in our division. 
- School bus safety is something I have been working on and want to keep working on. There needs to be legislation to allow for better enforcement. 
- Roads and access and parking in schools need to receive infrastructure support while promoting healthy living options
- We must keep ensuring quality education while still maintaining reasonable taxes on our ratepayer. The Province must be lobbied to increase operating support to education equally to all school divisions and not assume that some areas should tax their residents more. They announce 2% for the metro school divisions but distribute it unequally giving St. James Assiniboia students nearly 0% in operating grants for the last three years. With a large amount of our division composed of seniors and those on fixed income, this is an unfair burden. 
- Continue to promote safer schools and reduce bullying through supporting programs like Roots of Empathy
- Ensure that citizenship focuses on children, families and our community first</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>We have a wonderful ward with great families, terrific homeowners who work hard to make St. James a beautiful place to live. I want to continue to work towards keeping our community affordable, our schools top notch while ensuring that our educational community continues to work and strike to be a greater part of the community of St. James Assiniboia. We need to work with all partners in our community - business, community leaders  early childcare providers to ensure that we partner and grow together. We have a proud heritage and a terrific hope for the future. Our seniors provide wisdom, experience and stability while our new families enrich and provide diversity and opportunity. We need to know our past and work hard today in order to produce the positive results for the future.<br>
Our school division is the largest single employer in St. James Assiniboia and we have a duty to be fair employers, good stewards of the community and a positive contributor to residents. We need to protect and cherish our tax rate while providing quality education to all our students. </p>
