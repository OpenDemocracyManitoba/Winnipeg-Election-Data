class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I am passionate about public education. I have been a public school educator form the Philippines for 10 years and continiued my teaching carrer here in Manitoba for 26 years..
My experiences from a classroom teacher to an administrator gave me some insights as to what can I do to help my community.  My children went to public schools in the Seven Oaks SchoolDivision. At present my two grandchildren are in the  Seven Oaks Schools as well. As a citizen of the country  I have the rights and priviledges to contribute and to help effect changes in the  operation of public school system to meet the needs of our children who are the future citizens of the  country.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I am very well versed with  the governance of a school board. I bring a wealth of experiences in terms of collaborative and cooperative process  in order to effect decision making.
For the past 6 years as Trustee in Seven Oaks School Division, I have been involved in different  CHALLENGING comiittees such as: SOTA Negotiations, Professional Development,of staff, Joint Board and SOTA .Advisory Council, Sustainability , Heriatge Languages and others.
Being the Vice- President of the Manitoba School Board Association I am knowledgeable on how school trustees concerns and priorities of the province such as :
Mental health, Aboriginal Education, poverty and  just diversity, and equity</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Building capacity to strengthen community relationship is very crucial because Seven Oaks is a highly diverse ethnic community. We have to reach out the newly immigrant s, Aboriginals to establish Treaty relationships, 
Our intergenarational community are a strong source of experiences that can be shared to both older,seniors and students. Respecting values,customs and traditions eliminate stereotyping and promote closer relationship
Alternative programs to enhance students to help them finish secondary education and to pursue their post secondary education. such as vocational courses and other life skills programs needed to succeed in the 22nd century.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I appreciate the welcoming gestures of Seven Oaks Community regardless of ethnicity, status and place they live in.. I have been in this vibrant community for 40 years and I am very fortunate to be in thie north end of the city filled with very nice people . It is a place ldescribed lke a rainbow of colours. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am asking my community to re-elect me again so I can continue to help them in several ways. I am trustworthy, action orientedI  and love my community.</p>
