<p>Education is the foundation of a civil, healthy society.
Four years ago, I was honoured to be elected. Some of the reasons that I ran included;
building more schools and providing more more daycare spaces (funded by the province),
lowering our taxes and increasing our high school graduation rates. 
We have achieved most of these oblectives!
I like to build on these achievements and add several other objectives including; the most active/healthy and the brightest students in Seven Oaks School Division.   </p>

Fifteen years of experience as a youth employment trainer with the Province of Manitoba.
Long-time member with the Manitoba Round Table for Sustainable Development, the Winipeg Arts Council  and several community
organizations.
Volunteer of the year - Recreation Sports. 
Graduate of The Institute of Corporate Directors &amp; Governance</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>Lowering our education taxes
Opening all our school gyms longer hours after school, that students and community members can have more recreation sports and activities
at no cost.
Providing more daycare spaces for our fast growing community.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The Seven Oaks School Division/Board of Trustee and the staff find ways to meet the needs of every student that that
attends our schools. We are a proactive Division and we are always looking for solutions. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Education is a very important. I am asking the residents to re-elect me that I can continue to serve our community.
I am proud of the Seven Oaks School District.</p>
