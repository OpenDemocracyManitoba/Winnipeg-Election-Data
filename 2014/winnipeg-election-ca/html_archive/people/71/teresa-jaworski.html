class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I care,
I want to make a difference.
I have always had a strong belief in the value of education and its role in shaping our future. Our children are the leaders of tomorrow
I am committed to student success and maintaining standards of excellence in education to ensure each child achieves to the best of their ability.
I care deeply about our schools and children and I am confident in my believe that I can make a difference.
I also would like to continue the work the Division is doing with its commitment to equity.
Excellence and equity for all children.  .</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>Proudly represented my community as a Trustee for eight years.
-  I have been a long time resident of Seven Oaks School Division, Garden City eleven years and West Kildonan  fifteen years. 
-  B.Sc. Chemistry and Molecular Biology.

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<ul>
<li> I will always stand for our children: - That education is an amazing experience for each and every child. - That each and every child has a success story. -That each and every child being educated to lead &quot;fulfilling lives within the world as moral people and contributing members of society.&quot;</li>
<li> For our children to thrive they must be given all the necessary tools and supports: - We must ensure that our schools and classrooms have best possible learning conditions -- are safe and caring for all .-  We must ensure that our schools are ready and able to meet the needs of all our learners - each and every child achieves to the best of their ability - We must ensure that our Public Education System is the best it can be - For we are educating our Nation and shaping our future.</li>
<li> I feel the ultimate reward is seeing our students walk across the stage to receive their diplomas and knowing we have done our best to prepare them for their next stage of life whether it be college, university or workforce.<br></li>
</ul>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<ul>
<li> Knowing that some children are disadvantaged means accepting the responsibility to help them overcome the obstacles they face - poverty, disability, racism.</li>
<li> In Seven Oaks our Board has worked hard to remove barriers to participation and help parents make end meet by eliminating fees associated with the education, no cost for field trips and school activities, free or low cost after hour and summer programs, low cost school supplies, free lunch supervision, learn to swim and learn to skate programs.
Middle Years students are provided with band instruments free of charge.</li>
<li> We provide rich educational opportunities to students who would otherwise go without them.</li>
<li> We do it all &quot;one kid at a time&quot; and we do it all to make a difference.<br></li>
</ul>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>
