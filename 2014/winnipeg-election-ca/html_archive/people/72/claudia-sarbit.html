class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I am a long time resident and school trustee in the Seven Oaks School Division and have 2 children who attended schools in Seven Oaks.  I have been extensively involved in Seven Oaks as a board member and volunteer.  I am dedicated to this community and its children and want to continue to use the skills and knowledge I have acquired to ensure that every child enjoys success at school and beyond and that the division maximizes children&#39;s talents, aptitudes and abilities. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>The following are some of my experiences: Past Chair-Seven Oaks School Board, Present Vice-Chair, Suburban Director-Manitoba School Boards Association, Former Teacher, Co-Chair-Board Workplace, Safety and Health Committee, Board Policy Chair, Co-chair Board/Teacher Advisory Committee, Founding Board Member and President-7Oaks Education Foundation, Founding Board Member-Kildonan Youth Activity Centre, President-H.C. Avery Parent Council, Member-7Oaks Neighborhood Resource Network, Soccer Convenor-Garden City Community Centre, Chair-Heart and Stroke Foundation Winnipeg Residential Campaign, Chair-Canadian Mental Health Association Winnipeg Provincial Walk.  Awarded the Governor-General&#39;s  Commerative Medal for Community Service. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I believe in an education system that embraces the uniqueness of every child, develops critical thinkers, supports those students who are disadvantaged in some way and has a diversity of programs and opportunities to ensure greater student access to an excellent education in safe caring environments.  To that end, I have advocated for or supported: the award winning MET School, the Wayfinders tutoring program, comprehensive music, arts, sports, after school, preschool and co-operative vocational programs plus the establishment of gay-straight alliances, specific aboriginal and poverty initiatives and professional develpment for staff to help us reach these goals.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>Despite our budget restricions, based on an unfair provincial funding formula, Seven Oaks School Division has been able to provide award winning programs and  vast opportunities for its students that are effective.  We partner with our parents and community organizations to help us reach our goals.  As a result, the division has achieved a 90 percent graduation rate and increased student enrolment in post secondary institutions. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I would appreciate your vote on October 22nd.<br>
 I would welcome the opportunity to hear from you and share our ideas for the future of our education system.
