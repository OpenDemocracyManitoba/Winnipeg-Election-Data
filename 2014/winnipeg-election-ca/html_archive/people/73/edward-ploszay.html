class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I decided to run in the 2014 election based on the following point indicated below: 
-Life long resident of the Seven Oaks School Division. 
-Former Seven Oaks School Division graduate of West Kildonan Colligate class of 1979. 
-I was involvement with my children&#39;s elementary school education at Victory School and was chair of the parent council for seven years. 
-Former chair of the West Kildonan Residents Association.
-Being a trustee of the SOSD allows for continued involvement in my community which is something I have always been passionate about. 
-I am a strong advocate of public education as it is essential in building strong communities and in turn benefits the city and province as a whole. 
-Being a graduate of the SOSD and having influential teachers I feel this is a way to give back to the community and school division for their help in shaping my career and future. 
-Ensure that their is a variety of programs in the schools to allow students to follow their desired path and strive for excellence in whichever field they choose. 
-I would like to keep the board open and transparent to students, parents and tax payers.      </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>The first experience that would compliment my role as school trustee is that I have had two children involved within the SOSD; my daughter, a graduate of West Kildonan Colligate class of 2012 and my son a current student at Garden City who will be a graduate of the class 2015. Being a graduate of Red River Collage and the University of Manitoba I will bring a business background to the board looking for cost savings on the operation side of the division, which can then be put back into the schools to benefit students and teachers. In addition, I was also part of the policy committee (chair), students liaison and negotiating committee of the teachers association of the SOSD.  During the years 2011-2012 I also served as vice-chair of the division and most recently served as chair from 2013-2014. Lastly, I am a member of the Purchasing Management Association of Canada and hold a professional designation (SCMP). </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>One of my top priorities within the division is to have equitable funding for our schools, which will lessen the burden of taxation of home owners within the division. This issue is important to me because it will allow for more programs to be incorporated into our schools, which can range from the free lunch program, to the skate program all the way to our adult education program. Increasing the funding would ensure even more programs could be implicated within the schools providing teachers with more resources to develop children into bright and independent students. The second issue I would like to stand for as a trustee is ensuring that students at elementary schools are taught sufficient reading, math and writing skills, as those subjects are necessary to have continued success in the following school years and future careers. It is essential to have support and resources available for the teachers to address which students need assistance and provide them with the required help ensuring that the issue is taken care at a young age. This subject is important to me as I was a student who struggled in my early school years, however I received help from dedicated teacher. </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>One thing I particularly appreciate about the school division is the fact that it takes pride in welcoming new members, different ethnicities and the community at large. As a very diverse community, the division ensures cultural beliefs and traditions are preserved through a variety of language programs, workshops and community celebrations. The division takes pride in their multi-cultural students and staff who reflect the communities diversity.    </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I will donate my salary as School Trustee to your Parent Councils, as I genuinely care about the betterment of our schools. I have donated my annual School Trustee salary for the past eight years (two terms) and will continue to do so. This sizeable donation has provided monthly funding for library books throughout the Seven Oaks School Division. Both teachers and children participate in book buying to promote literacy in our schools. I respectfully ask for your continued support in this upcoming election as I am running to ensure the future generations of this community can be successful in whichever future endeavor they choose.   </p>
