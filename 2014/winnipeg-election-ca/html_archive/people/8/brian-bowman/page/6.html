class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I decided to run to be the Mayor of Winnipeg because I believe that with the right leadership, vision and guidance, Winnipeg can fully realize its potential. 
When I decided to run, I saw a city that was plagued by scandal, audits and backroom deals. I saw a city that was struggling to maintain the quality of services and infrastructure that our citizens deserve. I want to bring positive change to the city of Winnipeg and restore our citizens’ faith in city hall by bringing openness and transparency to it. I will help rebuild our crumbling infrastructure by repairing our roads in the short-term, while supporting smarter growth of our city. 
I also decided to run to be the Mayor of Winnipeg because I want to make Winnipeg work better for its citizens.  I want a city that is open and transparent, that has better infrastructure, stronger and safer communities, and a real long-term economic plan. I want a better city for my family and for everyone elses families. I want to live in a city that supports small businesses and the creation of jobs. I want to live in a city that encourages our youth to stay in Winnipeg.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Mayor?</h3>

<p>I have always been a passionate supporter of Winnipeg. I have prided myself in being an active community volunteer and have had the pleasure of leading many of our city’s community organizations.<br>
Previously, I have been the Chair of the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce, and under my leadership, we launched the BOLD Initiative. My leadership and vision, assisted in bringing about the creation of YES!Winnipeg, The World Trade Centre, and the Centralia Conference (that showcased Winnipeg to 600 companies from 30 countries).
In my professional life, I am a privacy lawyer, and have been recognized as a national leader in the areas of social media, access to information, and privacy law. 
As the Chair of the Winnipeg Art Gallery (WAG), it was my vision to increase the visibility and accessibility for the WAG.  As Chair, I supported greater programming for school children and a variety of non-profit community partners. This vision also helped the WAG continue to see strong surpluses and greater overall community engagement.</p>

<p>I have also served on many other community not-for-profits, including, Ka Ni Kanichihk, the Manitoba Naturalists Society, and as President of the University of Manitoba Alumni. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Mayor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>It is abundantly clear that infrastructure is the number one issue for Winnipeggers. One of the reasons that I decided to run for Mayor of Winnipeg is that I realized that as we approached a population of one million people, it was evident that our city would not be prepared for this due to years of poor leadership at City Hall and a lack of forward thinking vision. 
The second major issue that has been identified from the beginning of this campaign was transparency at City Hall. As Mayor of Winnipeg, I will restore faith in City Hall by implementing our Open Data policy. 
From an infrastructure and development perspective, this means that the tendering process will be transparent. There will be no more backroom deals and all members of the construction industry (or any industry for that matter) will know the expectations are, and needs are, with respect to any given project. Everyone will be on the same playing field throughout the tendering process. </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the City of Winnipeg?</h3>

<p>Simply put, it is our people. I decided to run for Mayor, for our citizens, for our children and for Winnipeg. I am running for the Mayor of Winnipeg, in order to provide a positive, inclusive environment for all of our citizens.
We have the absolute pleasure of living in such a diverse community. This diversity will be celebrated and honoured throughout my service as the Mayor of Winnipeg. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I encourage everyone to inform themselves of all of the candidates who are running and I encourage everyone to go out and vote. 
Please feel free to visit my website for further information as to why I am running for the Mayor of Winnipeg.  It is my vision to have a city that is open and transparent, that has better infrastructure, stronger and safer communities, and a real long-term economic plan.
I thank each and every one that I have met throughout this campaign. I thank you for your vote and I look forward to serving the City of Winnipeg as your Mayor. </p>
