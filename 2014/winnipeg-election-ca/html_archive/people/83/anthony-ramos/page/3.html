class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I would like to bring back confidence and trust back to City Hall, though more pressing to me throughout my eight years as a Winnipeg Scchool Division Trustee is the child poverty rate in the inner city neighbourhoods of the Point Douglas Ward. I want to be ACTIVE, ACCESSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE to all of the citizens in the ward in order to address the great infrastructural challenges, the need for more youth activiities and resources, and in my opinion the need to develop and grow the emerging technical skills among young people that are currently living in the ward, specifically in the area of internet security and cyber defence.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?</h3>

<p>I have been very fortunate to serve 2 terms as School Trustee in the Winnipeg School Division. I would like to thank all those who have supported me throughout that time and I hope that I was able to address the right issues and maintain the programming, services and achievement that the schools in the Winnipeg School Division have been able to realize. As a City of Winnipeg Councillor I would love to further support WSD schools in the ward of Point Douglas in their education and support of students and families.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>As I have mentioned infrastructure has been the outcry for many voters acoss the city and will definitely be a priority of the incoming elected council. The need for safety and resources for young people experiencing life on the streets must definitely be addressed as way of protecting the future of our city. The need to support and reinforce our frontline services in Waste/Water, Fire/EMS/and Police, as well as Public transportation is a priority as they are the foundation of any well run city. I envision all of this through a City council that is truthful and accountable to citizens in order to realize any common goals for the good of the City of Winnipeg. While specifically for the ward itself I woudl like to alleviate the disparity that some communities experience as far as recreational facilities and resources that are vital to healthy and happy well being for livelihood of those in the ward communities.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>The tremendous diversity and variety of people, neighbourhoods and amenities that exist in the ward. Throughout all the various communities that may differ demographically and economically they are united in the common ideals of safe and healthy lifetsyles for the growth and development of their families and communities.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I would like to wish all the candidates running for every office the very best. I hope that they are truly motivated by the need to serve the city and needs of all ward residents and communities regardless of the difference in issues or concerns. The united vision to promote and support issues that are for the good of the city of WInnipeg and their communities must be at the forefront of their campaigns.</p>
