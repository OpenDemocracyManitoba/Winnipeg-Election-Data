class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?</h3>

<p>I entered because I have brand new, and unique ideas for the City of Winnipeg.  I want to give these ideas to the citizens and a gift so that Winnipeg can move forward into the modern world.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Mayor?</h3>

<p>The role of the mayor is an administrative role.  I have 30 years of experience in business administration.  No other candidate has that qualification.  </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Mayor, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>As the public is aware, the main item on my campaign is &quot; To fix the roads &quot;.  Why is this so important ?  We are the laughed at by the whole country when it comes to our roads.  They have been looked and studied, talked about for years, but to no avail.  They have  been ignored to a point of being dangerous. I plan to attack this issue with a vengeance as mayor.  The absolute first thing that I will do as mayor is to arrange funding for this massive undertaking.  I am the man for this job.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the City of Winnipeg?</h3>

<p>What I appreciate about Winnipeg is the preservation of our culture diversity.  We do not act as a melting pot. The nationalities that exist in this city have the complete chance of keeping their language and their culture. They are actually encouraged to keep them.  Folklorama is the Christmas of culture display.</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Keep on checking my You Tube channel.  For those who do not know, I filmed this summer 20 small films for my campaign.  I incorporated a little lip singing, a little dance, a little comedy to lighten things up but these videos do display what I stand for.  Enjoy the show.</p>
