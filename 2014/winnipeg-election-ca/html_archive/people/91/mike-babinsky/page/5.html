class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>As a father of six children and five grandchildren, I have a vast interest in our public education system.  </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I have been a member of the Winnipeg School Division Board of Trustees since 1995.  I am currently the senior Trustee on the Board, and I believe my experience and strong independent voice will benefit my community.</p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>The issues that are most important to me are those that are brought forward to me from the community.
I believe the constituents elect me to be their voice. Their opinion counts.</p>

<p>As a Trustee, transparency and accountability are very important.  I have always tried my best to keep my community aware of the issues and decisions that are discussed and implemented at the Division.  </p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>I was born, raised, and still live in Ward 8. I raised my family in this community and ran the largest outdoor sports program for all ages in this community at the Old Exhibition Grounds for 25 years.<br>
I believe my ward is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the city and filled with the most exceptional people. It has always been a community with many cultural backgrounds. What I appreciate the most about my ward is that no matter how different we are, we all have so much in common. </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>Nothing is more important to our families and our community than our children, and I am proud to serve as their School Trustee. I would be honored to continue.  </p>
