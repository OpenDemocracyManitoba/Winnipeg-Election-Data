race</a>.</p><p>There are <a href="#recent_news">217 recent news articles</a> that mention Mark Wasyliw.</p><p class="small grey">Learn <a href="/pages/13/frequently-asked-questions#candidate_info">how we decide</a> what candidate information to list.</p></div><div class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>After 3 years on the Board I have gotten a good picture of what needs to be changed in the Winnipeg School Division (WSD).  The Division has an achievement gap between students from wealthy households and those struggling with poverty.  I believe the School Board can do more to close this gap and ensure all students can be successful in our education system.  To that end, in my first term I was able to start a full-day nursery/full-day kindergarten pilot program.  We placed this program into four of our lowest socio-economic schools. Often in these school, students fall behind and never catch up with other students in the division.  The added time with trained teachers in the nursery and kindergarten program has dramatic results in helping these students catch up to other students in the WSD.  We are monitoring this program closely and if successful, my priority is to expand the program to other schools in the division on a &quot;need&quot; basis.</p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I have been on the Board of Trustees since my by-election win in 2011.  I have been elected vice-chair of the Winnipeg School Division for the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 School years.  I have been a member of the Finance Committee, French Language Advisory Committee, South End Advisory Committee, Must Fund Committee of MSBA, Winnipeg Teacher&#39;s Association Committee, and the Ward Boundaries Review Committee.</p>

<p>I am a lawyer by career and own and operate a 10 lawyer law firm where I am the managing partner.  I have handled million dollar budgets in the private sector as well as managing 15 employees.  At the WSD I help administer  a 374 million dollar budget.  </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I am committed to closing the achievement gap between students of differing socio-economic backgrounds.  I am committed to the expansion of Full Day Nursery/ Full Day Kindergarten programs.  </p>

<p>I am committed to prioritizing funding for the arts, science and math education.  I want to continue to reform how the Division conducts math instruction in the early years and see that the WSD becomes a leader in this area.  I am interested in expanding enrichment programs in the WSD including creating an IB program for the middle years.  I would also like to see the WSD develop a junior and senior high Arts Academy where students can receive special training in theatre, music, film, graphic and classical arts.</p>

<p>I am committed to making the WSD more environmentally sustainable.  I would like to develop an active transportation policy and create a division wide &quot;walking school bus&quot; program.  I want to continue with our energy retrofits of our aging buildings and the continual upgrading of our water lines to allow more water bottle refilling stations in our schools.</p>

<p>I am committed to lobbying  the government to increase funding to schools to ease the burden on property taxpayers.</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>My ward is diverse.  With the neighbourhoods of Earl Grey, Fort Rouge, Crescentwood and North River Heights the needs and expectations of the citizens are varied.  Each neighbourhood has its own concerns and challenges and special care needs to be given to address each communities priorities.  </p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I believe in an education system that enhances democracy, builds citizenship and develops community in our youth.  I value diversity, inclusion, creativity, and rigorous academic standards.  All my decisions will have those values and goals in mind.</p>

<p>I want to see students who are creative, who are engaged in critical thinking and who are socially responsible.  The policies that I will support and the initiatives I will create will have that as there focus.  </p>
