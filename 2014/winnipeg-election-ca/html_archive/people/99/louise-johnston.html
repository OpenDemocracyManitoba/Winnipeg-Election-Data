class="three-columns"><h2>Questionnaire Response</h2><div class="questionnaire"><h3>Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?</h3>

<p>I make supporting public education a priority!  I believe strongly that education is our most powerful tool in making positive changes in the world, and that it is our responsibility to educate all students. 
Today, I am just as passionate about running as when I was first elected.  As lifelong residents and graduates from this division, myself and my family have been active volunteers in both schools and community centers for years. 
There are many issues in Public Education today that need to be addressed.  We need more collaboration and transparency to rebuild the public&#39;s trust.  I feel that I have the experience and drive to make a difference. </p>

<h3>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?</h3>

<p>I bring 20 plus years proudly serving as a School Trustee, first on the Norwood School Division Board, then on the amalgamated Board of Norwood and St. Boniface and now Louis Riel School Division Board.
I am fluently bilingual in French and English
As an established leader in the Winnipeg Human Resource Management and Training Community, I bring considerable business experience. I have significant education and continue to be a lifelong learner.
I have served as both Chair and Vice Chair on the Board of Trustees as well being a leader and member of multiple committees. In addition,  I have served on the Manitoba School Boards Association, as member of several committees, executive and am currently serving on the MSBA Pension Trustees Board. </p>

<h3>What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?</h3>

<p>I am a strong advocate for the equal and fair treatment for all students.
A strong bilingual voice in providing increased opportunities for all students. 
An advocate for strengthening of vocational and arts programs
A strong supporter of Professional Development for all employees of the Louis Riel School Division.<br>
A strong voice in pursuing increased provincial government financial support while reducing the burden of higher taxes for constituents.
These  issues are of paramount importance to me as each child deserves the best possible education....they are our future!</p>

<h3>What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?</h3>

<p>One thing in particular that I appreciate about the Louis Riel School Division - Ward 1 is it&#39;s rich cultural and historical foundation.  We have wonderful and authentic experiences for our students, staff and community.  There is a high level of engagement of educators, parent and students!</p>

<h3>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</h3>

<p>I am as passionate as I was when I was first elected.  Through my experiences of 2 School Board Amalgamations I bring a background that no other candidate can offer. 
I strongly believe we learn from the past and this helps form a great future!</p>
